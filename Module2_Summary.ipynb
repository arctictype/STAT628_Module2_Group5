    "An increasing number of people like to search for some information on the website when they have some plans. Yelp is one of the sources people always look for because it provides reviews written by customers of many aspects such as food, service, cost, etc. By reading the reviews, we can easily tell the feelings that customers convey and guess the ratings. On the contrary, it's difficult for machines to understand the sentiment of a text. Therefore, our goal is to figure out what makes a review positive or negative and propose a model to predict the rating mainly based on the text of the review."

    "First, we look at the selected training data, finding that there is no missing value. Second, we draw a plot to see the distribution of stars which shows our sample is unbalanced. There are more reviews rated 4-5 stars than reviews rated 1-3 stars which means we tend to predict higher ratings for the business. Then we want to figure out the relation between stars and other variables.\n",
    "1. Text variable must have something to do with stars and almost all the documents we have read reveal the model based on text variable alone. Also, we check the distributions of the length of characters for each star level that are slightly different but not a big deal. \n",
    "2. City, longitude and latitude tell the same information about the business location. From the map, we can see that the points are gathered into three parts but the distribution of stars for each part looks quite similar. Thus, we can ignore these variables.\n",
    "3. Categories may contain much information, but they don't have unified division. What's more, words in the categories are frequently mentioned in the text.\n",
    "4. From the year 2005 to the year 2017, the number of reviews is increasing mainly because Yelp is more and more popular over the years with the widespread of the Internet. However, when we check the percentage of each star levels, 1-3 stars remain the same while the percentage of 4 stars decreases and percentage of 5 stars increases. Star distribution is stable over the months. Thus, there may be a relation between stars and years.\n",

    "First, we look at the text variable and find that there are several texts written in the language other than English. Since the number is not large, we just ignore these texts. We use the average star level when we come across the other language texts in the prediction process.\n",
    "Then we remove noise from texts that include newline marks \"\\n\", punctuation except \"?\" and \"!\" which may express the feelings. As for stop words, we keep some words like \"her\", \"his\" and some negative words. We keep 26 letters and change them into lowercase. Afterward, we do Lexicon normalization to change the tenses of verbs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do the feature engineering, we want to create a word dictionary to count the occurrence of every unique word. However, considering the word \"never\", \"no\", \"not\" followed by a word may change the meaning of one sentence, we combine these three words with the word right after it when building the word dictionary. \n",
    "\n",
    "After creating the word dictionary, we notice that many words do not frequently appear with the count equal to one. In that case, we want to find a threshold to cut off the low-count words. After several trials, we decide to ignore the words whose count is less than ten.\n",
    "Then we start to select features. The histograms that show the relation between word and stars can tell a lot of information but we cannot go over 8000 histograms. Instead, we calculate the variance of stars for each word and select words with high variances. Before that, we do the following: scale the count of star levels for each word by the total counts, scale the count of star levels and scale function is log2 since the counts may differ a lot between words. As a result, we sort the words by their variance and select the top 1000 words. According to these words, we create a sparse matrix for the model.\n",
