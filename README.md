The project is to figure out what makes a review positive or negative and propose a prediction model to predict the ratings of reviews mainly based on the text. Module2_Summary.ipynb is the executive summary of our data analysis which provide a concise, replicable and clear description of our statistical analysis and findings. There are three folders providing more details about analysis. Present1.ppt and present2.ppt are the slides we used during presentations.
## Code folder
All the code files created during this project are in this folder including codes to do text processing, create words matrix, plots and the codes to propose different models.
## Image folder
Any images produced during analysis are included in this folder.
## Data folder
This folder contains some small size data set such as the word matrix we create and positive, negative wordlist. Some large size data files cannot be uploaded to Github but all of them can be reproduced by the code we provided.
