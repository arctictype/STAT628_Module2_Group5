1,McDonald's,"Seriously cannot stand this McDonald's. They NEVER get my order right. Food almost always sucks! Service is sorry! The employees sure do show they hate their jobs in the way they perform at work! I used to work at McDonald's as a teen getting through high school, don't remember that McDonald's ever taking so long in a drive-thru or being bitter about the fact I worked there! Lol And to top it all off, this is the McDonald's I live right across the street from :( so I find myself here more often than not! ugh! Get it together people! You guys are terrible! I honestly don't have anything nice to say about this place... I usually wouldn't review a place just to talk mess, but I waited at the drive-thru for 15 minutes this morning to get two coffees!!! Standards back when I worked there was a minute or less for each car!",2014-12-29,Glendale,-112.2050201,33.5095967,"['Burgers', 'Fast Food', 'Restaurants']"
5,Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak,"Amazing food, truly excellent best lobster bisque, and the prime rib, probably the bedt Ive had!!

5,Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant,"This was my second time here, and the seafood was just as awesome as I remembered! We got the King Crab & Lobster Dinner package. It comes with a soup, king crab cooked in 3 different ways (steamed, friend with dry garlic, and fried rice), HK style lobster (the lobster tower you see in all the photos), snow peas, and dessert. This package is meant for 4 people, and is $288 pre tax and tips. However, because all their king crabs were larger than the size that comes with this package (4.5lb), we had to pay additional for the extra weight. I think the amount of food that we got could probably have fed a party of 6. I love the fried lobster and crab legs here, both are super yummy! This restaurant is definitely worth a visit for any seafood lovers!

However, the restaurant does get very busy. So make sure to call ahead and make a reservation, esp if you plan on coming during the weekends! The tables in the restaurant are packed very tightly. The round table I was at was literally touching the table beside us. So don't come here if you are expecting a restaurant with a nice ambiance, or a place where you want to talk to your friends in private. Because the table beside you will definitely hear every word you are saying!",2015-11-24,Toronto,-79.3007954253,43.8242335814,"['Seafood', 'Restaurants', 'Chinese', 'Live/Raw Food']"
1,Bonjour Brioche,"Long story short.

Bunch of rude, heartless, and ignorant assholes run this place with no compassion for people especially people they feel do not belong or are suitable for their shitty establishment. 

My mother endured an extremely humiliating situation at Bonjour Brioche. She went in on a Saturday to wait for 45 mins with her cane, with nowhere to sit while she waited for her friend. A number of people who were waiting after her were seated before her, and she asked when she would get a seat until her friend arrived. She'd like to have a coffee while she waited. 

Basically was told, your friend's not here; tough shit no seat you can wait. She asked well what if my guest cancelled last minute and I would like to eat alone. Are you not going to serve me even if I sit and have something alone? 
they then started to tell her that they get that excuse all the time and that she could not get a table until her friend arrived. 

As she asked for the manager, her friend arrived at the same time. She explained to the manager that she's been waiting with her cane, hasn't been given a table and that people after her had been seated even if they were waiting for others. She felt demeaned and didn't appreciate the service and that she would be taking business somewhere else. Instead of the manager making some arrangement to ease the situation she told my mother that she can leave now. 

I have never in my life had my mother call me and cry on the phone of how humiliated and embarrassed she felt.

4,Dilly's Deli,"We grabbed some dinner here last night before catching a show at Gammage. 

We were the ONLY people in this place, yet the staff acted like they were slammed, very short with us and it took quite some time for our order to come out.

The food was good, though the bread bowls that the soup came in tasted like they were a few days old, very dry and crumbly vs the normal super fresh tasting bread bowls you get here.",2010-09-28,Tempe,-111.9453653,33.4221754,"['Caterers', 'Sandwiches', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Delis', 'Burgers', 'Restaurants']"

1,The Good Egg,"Me and wife have been going to the good egg since 2010, and this good egg since it opened.  This use to be our favorite place, close to home, gym and good food.  However, they have really gotten worse and worse for the past few months.  The service is hit and miss, the wait staff his also hit and miss.  We went on sunday march 6 and had to wait for food for over 30 minutes, food was cold and did not taste as good as usual, and the service was the worse.  We plan on going to biscuits or haymakers from now on.  Or Cracker Barrel, they are at least consistent",2016-03-08,Glendale,-112.1401263,33.7142832,"['Restaurants', 'Breakfast & Brunch']"

3,Zoozacrackers Deli,"What do you do if it's getting close to midnight and you still haven't had dinner because you've been sipping on margaritas in the lounge instead? One option is to head here for a quick nosh. I got the pastrami on rye (I felt the need to add the ""on rye"" when I ordered because I wasn't sure, being this is Vegas, if they might try to serve it on Wonder Bread), and while it's certainly not the best deli I had had, it will do in a pinch.

3,Anjappar Chettinad Restaurants,"I saw this restaurant on a whim when I was looking for a good indian food place to try and decided that this was the one. We opted for delivery because why not.

I usually judge the place based on my all time favourite Butter chicken and when I got it for sure this place has it down! It surpassed the other ones I tried and for sure this is where am getting it from now on.

Aside from that dish, we also got the chicken tikka masala and the garlic naan bread. The masala was alright, I tasted a better one elsewhere so this one wasn't really my favourite from them. And the garlic naan was yummy. Really generous with the garlic for sure. 

And I also got a Mango lassi, I didnt like their version that much so I think I'll skip on this one next time.

Anyway, I have yet to try their other dishes in the future so for now am just giving them three stars. And also the other reason for the rating was because our food arrived late. Am glad I waited a little bit more because I was close to complaining. But other than that, food is decent and I would order from them again.",2016-05-17,Mississauga,-79.6419661,43.5995957,"['Indian', 'Buffets', 'Halal', 'Restaurants']"
5,The King's Kitchen,"In town for a conference and checked Yelp for great local spots to eat. This place was recommended by the hotel staff and Yelp reviews only reinforced their recommendations. 

Atmosphere was great. Packed, but got seated quickly. Service was very friendly and suggested a couple specials. I had the pork chop dinner....it was incredible. The chop was so juicy. The polenta was great, and the glaze sealed the deal. Top 3 best meals of all time!! Im serious. 

The $9 house salad was disappointing (bland, no salt n pepper or flavor) with a ranch dressing that didnt come close to the flavor of ranch, more like a creamy herb I couldnt identify.  But I tell you, the pork chop meal completely made up for it. 

My colleagues got the gumbo and said it was really good, as well as the fried chicken. I very well may go there again tomorrow because it was that good!!",2014-10-16,Charlotte,-80.844322,35.227757,"['American (Traditional)', 'Restaurants', 'Southern', 'Bakeries', 'Food']"

Easily one of the best sushi places on town with a good atmosphere and good service.

Best things to eat/ recommendations:
1. Sashimi salad.  This thing was amazing.  A nice pile of salmon, yellowtail, and albacore with sweet cucumber and shrimp. 

2.  Be happy roll: surprise crunch inside a savory tuna, salmon, avocado roll.

3.  The shit.  This appetizer acts like as stuffed jalapeño but without the super spicy kick.

2,Gia Lai,"Like many other Yelpers, I stopped by with my Mom and sister for a late lunch and walked into a entirely empty restaurant. That always puts me on high alert since it's usually not a good sign. 

I ordered the beef pho, my sister got the chicken pho and my mom got the glass noodle chicken soup. We also tried the spring rolls and the crab rangoon. The spring rolls were just okay, but the crab rangoon I found to be super-greasy. And I've ordered this dish from some pretty seedy take-out places. It's never tasted that strange. My mom's soup came out with shrimp and some weird pork in it and had to be sent back. When dining with two other people, all eating soup, well... that's just unfortunate since cold soup isn't appetizing and eating while you're hungry mother waits isn't fun either.  My pho was just okay. My favorite pho spots in CLE blow what they served me out of the water, but it was edible. 

The server was very apologetic, but overall I just didn't find the value there for the quality of food you actually get. 

I will say they serve up some damn good, fresh limeade and sparkling limeade!",2014-11-24,Lyndhurst,-81.500377126,41.5031356085,"['Restaurants', 'Vietnamese', 'Asian Fusion']"

2,Sammy's Woodfired Pizza And Grill,"No idea how the food here is. The apathetic hostess informed us that they were out of pizza, before we sat down, so we passed.

I've been around the food industry for a while, and this sort of thing tells me a lot about their attitudes. I would never eat at a place that runs out of their signature dish on a weekday afternoon.

It didn't feel like I was chewing on chicken at all; honestly. The food looked very attractive but it was soo disturbing.  I gagged 4-6 times in front of my own grandmother.  I felt like I was on Fear Factor doing the 2nd challenge!  The worst part is that becuz there are so few Chinese food places in Pickering, people are tricked into thinking that spicy dragon is the best.  It breaks my heart.

Les entrées étaient plutôt réussies: le duo de crab cake était savoureux et goûtait vraiment le crabe (un critère rarement respecté au resto!), alors que le chèvre chaud était goûteux mais était beaucoup trop sucré à mon avis (pomme cuite + BEAUCOUP de miel + caramel balsamique = trop!). C'est davantage au plat principal que notre expérience nous a déçus. Le duo de tartare (saumon et boeuf) manquait de saveur. Le tartare de boeuf n'était pas relevé, le tartare de saumon était insipide. La salade d'accompagnement baignait encore une fois dans sa vinaigrette, ce qui la rend impossible à manger et les frites sont très ordinaires (ne goûtent que le gras, texture sèche). Pour sa part, le ravioli de cerf aux champignons et à l'huile de truffe était beaucoup trop concentré en saveur. J'essayais d'enlever la sauce de mes pâtes avant de prendre une bouchée, ce n'est pas peu dire. Point fort de la soirée? Le long island iced tea: cocktail parfaitement bien exécuté!

The BF ordered the turkey sandwich with 1/2 & 1/2 of the offered sides, sweet potato & kale salad. I had a taste of each of the three items and they were all delicious. Next time, I'm ordering something from the sandwich column.

We also got their flour-less chocolate cake togo & ate it for breakfast the next morning w/our coffee. Yum.

3,Momofuku Noodle Bar,"My friend and I went to Momofuku for dinner during their first opening weekend. Thank goodness we arrived 20min before opening since there was already a line up when we got there. We managed to get a seat right at the windows which was a little awkward considering the fact that people outside can watch you eat.

 I read a number of reviews and opt to go for the Momofuku ramen, the rice cakes, the pork buns, and the Slushie. I thought the ramen was alright but nothing to rave about. I did like the pork belly that was used in it. The rice cakes were great! They were chewy and had the right about of hotness to it (compare to the ones you would get at Korean places where it was just too hot!). The best part was the pork buns. The pork belly was so moist and tender and the bun was just so soft. I would definitely go back there for them. 

The Slushie was interesting. It was both hot/sour and really hits you when you first take a sip of it. Really not for those who don't like hot/sour tastes.
 
Overwall, I thought the Noodle Bar was good even though the ramen wasn't that impressive. But the prok buns did win me over and I wouldn't mind going back there to try the others.

This place recently opened and our server was very attentive and took the time to explain the menu to us. He strongly favored the halibut tacos and said they were his single favorite thing on the menu so I ordered them. 

I need to note we were here for lunch so this is only a lunch review based on just one visit.

I soon received them and they were I think the most figure friendly meal I ever had out. Aprox. three oz. of halibut between two lettuce leaves (instead of tortillas) , pickled onion , Mexi style tomatoes , avocado , radish,  some crunchy greens and a very mild sauce. This plate was a bit on the mild side for my taste but maybe the intention of the dish was to taste the fish and not to over power it. This plate came with a side of black beans that were seasoned and had some flavors going on. This seemed like a very healthy meal to have out. I also liked that they used halibut and not something like muddy catfish or tilapia.

My husband tried the Charcuterie. It was sort of like an around the world kind of plate. It had five kinds of meat , a Chinese Sausage, a Hungarian Sausage, Italian Meats, Fig Jam, Toast, whole grain mustard, pickles, olives and a wedge of Brie Cheese.

I noticed an interesting Connecticut Style Steamed burger on the menu that you just don't find too often that might have been fun to try. Someone seated next to us got one and I thought it looked good.

3,Ciao Wine Bar,"I came here with high hopes for the Summerlicious menu. We started with the orecchiette though I should have ordered salad. It was a very generous portion for an appetizer and, along with the bread, filled us up quite substantially before we got to the ravioli. The ravioli was hearty, but also a bit heavy. The sauce and cheese filling made for a really filling meal. By the time we got dessert, I was stuffed and could barely finish it. The espresso tart was very rich, though it lacked a particular delicacy. 

The restaurant was quite full when we arrived and they initially seated us on the corner near the stairs, which was not at all a pleasant spot, but before we got settled in, the waiter found us a better table. I really enjoyed the ambiance -- enough lighting to see the food but not too bright. The food was served gradually, allowing us ample time to talk and catch up. The one catch was probably that splitting the bill at the end of the meal was weird, as the waitress rounded up from half of the total, which isn't good practice.

Overall I would say that the ambiance outdid the food. I was expecting something a little more delicate and less like what I can make for myself at home. It was worth a try though as I'd gotten a really good impression from the website and other reviews. I would probably not return unless something on the regular menu caught my eye.",2014-07-18,Toronto,-79.3936453,43.6704754,"['Wine Bars', 'Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Italian']"
5,New York Flavor,Tried this place cause it was highly rated on yelp. It did not disappoint. I had the Basil Marscapone burger. My son had the special Deniro Burger. Mine was tasty but not a strong taste. I thought it could use a little more flavor. The Deniro burger was absolutely delicious. Very flavorful. The fries were great. I also tried the potato salad and that was meh. But overall I want to go back and try more items.

2,Copacabana Brazilian Steakhouse,"Pros:
The food was fantastic and the gentlemen walking around with the various steaks and meats were attentive. The dancers were energetic and a ton of fun to watch. A clean, aesthetically pleasing restaurant to dine in. 

Cons:
We saw our waitress a total of 3 times in the 2 hours that we dined there. Once to take our original drink orders, once more to refill our drinks after we bothered another waitress when we were thirsty, and last when we were paying our bill with a different server (perhaps a floor manager?) to ""thank"" us. I don't know about other diners but my husband and I need more than one or two glasses of water to tide us over with that rich of a meal. We try our best to be easy guests but it was a little annoying to sit and watch other tables be tended to all night (other diners seeing their servers 5-9 times in their dining experience) with us sitting there never seeing our server again. I don't know if it was her fault or the restaurant's for stretching her too thin but it was incredibly frustrating. 

For $50 a person (making a two person bill easily $150 with tax and tip), the service was ridiculous. I can go to a bar and spend less than $20 with my husband and get better service and feel more welcome than we did here.",2016-04-18,Toronto,-79.3878309801,43.6483440823,"['Bars', 'Restaurants', 'Nightlife', 'Brazilian', 'Barbeque', 'Steakhouses']"

I ordered the redneck club which has both pulled pork and brisket on it, along with some slaw...So, basically all of my dreams came true. And then I ordered the ghost pepper mac n' cheese as well. It is super spice and even more so when you add the inferno that is the ghost pepper bbq sauce. I loved it! My boyfriend ordered the ribs and the pepper jack mac n' cheese and was really happy with both. The ribs are intimidatingly large and a half rack was more than enough!

3 star because of its 'generous meat portions' -

Someone explained the entire menu and the restaurant concept (order and pay at the counter first and you help yourself to condiments, drinks, and utensils) when I sat down.  Two people came by halfway through our meals to see if everything was okay as well.

The food.  We had hummus with pita to start.  I love hummus so this was no different.  The portion is pretty small though so I probably wouldn't get it again.  We got the full pack share platter.  It came with the MOST oily delicious garlic bread.  Remember to eat these before they get cold and hard.  The large side of veggies was SMALL and flavoured poorly.  It also mainly had onions in it which weren't really cooked through so I didn't enjoy this at all.  The mash potato on the other hand great!  ok so the chicken.  It was pretty moist and had lots of flavour.  But I was hoping the skin would be crispy and instead it was kind of soggy. Who doesn't love eating crispy chicken skin right?!

However, our amazing waiter was extremely helpful coming up with gluten free options for me.  He made sure to tell me that they offer both quinoa and rice based pastas along with a variety of sauces and even brought me some g-free bread!!  When I ordered my pasta with vodka sauce, he even went out of his way to look up if a non-grain based vodka needed to be used.  For someone with a dietary restriction, it was so nice to have a waiter that went out of his way to help me find a dish that I could eat and truly enjoy!!

We each ordered a ramen, a side dish, and a drink as part of their lunch combo. The ramen soup-base was a little saltier than I'd prefer, but the toppings were very nicely done, especially the egg! I did tell them to leave off the green onions, but they forgot that, which was a little disappointing, considering they had no other orders then. The Karaage fried chicken and takoyaki balls were delicious and really nice to split between friends actually. 

Price-wise, it was $11.75 for the combo, which is a little higher than most lunches at ramen joints, but they include a side dish and drink along with it, so I suppose it balances out a little more.

Then, the waitress came back and did not apologize at all but simply said that he had to pick a different beer because they were out of that one.

They renovated this place to create a cool lounge/sports-bar/restaurant type of place, looks great. They also have free home delivery if you order above $25 I believe, which is fantastic!

The menu looks good but way overpriced, somewhat to expect for Townsquare but this is bad, however the orders were made for lunch, some sandwiches a burger etc.

40 minutes later the food comes out and now really makes the point that this is a disaster, now the food is not bad let's make that clear but average at best, combine that with the horrible seating and poor service my conclusion is don't even bother.

And because the sauce coated pretty much every fry, I ended up throwing the whole dish out after three bites - three bites was all I could muster.

3,Angela's,"Finally gotten a chance to try Angela's and I was a bit taken aback.  It's very unassuming on the outside, but nicely decorated on the inside... I felt a bit bad walking in with a t-shirt and shorts.

The menu is pretty big with a ton of options.  I ended up getting a glass of Cab Sav and the special:  baked cheese ravioli.  It was very good.

Our waitress was polite... a bit absent at times.  Didn't really affect the meal though.

The house salad dressing a creamy tomato basil dressing was pretty good.  At first I almost defaulted to ranch, but our server listed all of them off.

The portions are big, and the prices are  proportional to the dishes.  I'd say it's a solid 3-star that I want to give 4 to, but nothing really wowed me about my first visit.",2011-08-24,Charlotte,-80.7084629552,35.1719848281,"['Restaurants', 'Italian']"

The food is organic, non-GMO which is a bonus. Started with the Jalapeño Margarita ... That's got quite the kick. Complimentary chips and salsa were good. Salsa was good but not spicy. Fresh Guacamole made table side allows you to have it made spicy or mild, your choice. Husband and I chose the street tacos. You choose any three out of 6 different tacos and served with rice and beans. Friend ordered the chicken enchiladas and her husband ordered the carne asade bowl. The green sauce on the enchiladas was good but spicy! The bowl was huge and tasty. Also order the grilled corn as it is the bomb! The corn is sweet and juicy and the coating is salty and slightly cheesy. Ended the meal with the flan. All four of us shared one as we were all stuffed but had to try it.

There were several different kinds of sandwiches to choose from. I got the chicken salad and it was delicious. Everyone else really liked their sandwiches too. The salad was also really good. Not your typical garden or Cesar salad. I'm not quite sure what it was but it had chicken, tomatoes, and feta.. yummy. Now we must also discuss the huge dessert platter that was in front of us. It was filled with chocolate covered strawberries, brownies, cookies dipped in chocolate, and more! I've never seen a dessert try like that before for a work lunch. Of course, I had to try a few of the items and they were all so good!

I would definitely make my way to their physical location in the future so that I can try out some other items.

I can't give a full review exactly, since I've only ordered with other people from work and not picked anything up personally or seen the inside, BUT - seriously some of the best Thai I've ever had. The first time I ordered, I got tofu and string beans. Vegetables weren't steamed to mush, and tofu was still firm. The sauce was perfect - curry with just a little spice. 

I've also ordered their coconut soup - which is by far my favorite. Again, I wasn't the one making the order, but from what I heard they were super friendly, and definitely accomodating- they gave me tofu instead of the meat at no extra charge. The coconut wasn't overpowering, but it was just enough to smooth out the tang of the lime.

On my most recent visit I sat at the bar with my boyfriend. We went in for a late lunch on a Saturday afternoon. We never got any food, we were never asked if we wanted any food. The bartender, some girl with Little Mermaid red hair, was too busy flirty with the older gentlemen at the bar. After sitting for 20 minutes without so much as a greeting we flagged her over. I don't come here too often and can't remember the wine on the menu I like. I'm certain there is one I really don't like so I asked if I could try a taste of two. She was instantly annoyed, the look was apparent on her face. She brought over two tastes and left, not to return for another 13 minutes; at this point, I was timing. We ordered drinks, she brought them and then left the bar. She was then gone, just completely absent. 

We had to flag her down one of the servers to get the tab, paid and walked out. The service was terrible. You'd get better service(and food!) at a Taco Bell or McDonalds.",2016-12-02,Phoenix,-112.037502107,33.5075723503,"['American (New)', 'Southern', 'Seafood', 'Barbeque', 'Restaurants']"

While it was still fairly tasty, there was very minimal amount of anything except pasta, and the beans seemed mushy like from a can.

The servers are very friendly and so are the owners, who are always up front handling the take outs and phone calls.

The most difficult thing about dining here is deciding between all of the wonderful choices on the menu! I love the fact that they use local produce and meats whenever possible and their freshly baked bread baked is organic. They have one of the most extensive and impressive wine lists that I have seen in a while - but they have a knowledgeable wine steward who can help you ferret out a nice selection.

I'm not a vegetarian, but I do try to eat healthily.  That generally means, more veggies, less fat, less meat, more whole grains, more organic food...  Sadly, that often limits lunch choices to grilled chicken salads.

Tree Hugger's has lovely, lovely soup, great vegetarian and chicken (with fruit!) salads.  I recently had the black bean chimichanga-- black beans, rice and sweet potato in spices wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla and grilled.  It wasn't meat and it wasn't fried, yet it still managed to taste fantastic!  The chicken salad wrap is delish, but it really does need salt.  (I actually appreciate that, though, because most places over-salt everything.)

Fear not the vegan cookie!  Vegan baked goods are usually disgusting.  Sorry guys, but that brownish lump of oats, hemp seeds, coconut and carob is just not appealing.  Tree Huggers has somehow managed to make vegan cookies that are as desirable as plain old cookies!!!  I had a carrot ginger cookie-- think of a light carrot cake with an orange ginger glaze.

I settled for a slice of pepperoni and mushroom and a drink, all for $4.50.  The slice was enormous, plenty for a late dinner (pre-drinking meal) and the crust was perfection.  They don't skimp on the cheese and the sauc is nummy too.  I got to try a couple of bites of the more exotic slices my co-workers got, such as chicken cordon bleu pizza and pesto pizza.

The chicken is dry and the shrimp might be composed of rubber. The fact that the name of this place is called ""Thai Gourmet"" is ridiculous. This is Chinese food with a lime tossed on it.

Edit: I've actually thrown this away and ate Chef Boyardi for lunch. Which strangely tasted similar to the pad thai.",2012-05-29,Independence,-81.6419229,41.395817,"['Chinese', 'Thai', 'Restaurants']"
5,Moira Sushi,"I'm not one to go the traditional route. I prefer to pick several appetizers and add a few rolls when I am doing a sushi outing. OMG you have to have the Hama Chili, Crackling Calamari, Tuna Poke and Sunshine Roll. I love spice but when you pair it with grapefruit, anyone can take the heat on the Hama Chili. The Crackling Calamari isn't your vanilla appetizer you find elsewhere. Amidst the crispy tentacles, you have a treasure trove of Asian mushrooms, cabbage and crunchy textures that spoil your tastebuds. And if that isn't enough to have you lusting, the Tuna Poke is amaze balls. I love the rice crackers because it's the only way to ""permissibly"" allow you to scrape the bowl without looking like you lack etiquette. To cleanse your palate of the explosion of happiness erupting in your mouth, the Sunshine Roll is an delish crowd pleaser and closing for your tasting. For someone with a linebacker appetite, I have to admit I was very happily content. Happy belly happy face!!!!

From all the various Buddhas to the chainlink bathroom entrance, I love the setup because it immediately invites you in with the shimmering lights dancing above the bar and the dark decor to be flirtacious. And who can resist a big Asian DJ spinning the best 80s tunes as you down your cold saki to forget the hot days of summer ahead. Definitely making another trip back and will check out happy hour with my entourage. You will not regret it!!! This place oozes sexy and those items are pure seduction.",2014-06-23,Phoenix,-112.070371,33.4564189,"['Restaurants', 'Japanese', 'Sushi Bars']"
5,Archi's Thai Kitchen,"This place deserves 5 stars based on these 3 things:

1. AFFORDABLE PRICE: My parents, sister and I visited this place on a Sunday night while visiting Vegas for the weekend.  We ordered soup, pad thai, chicken larb, seafood salad, stuffed chicken wings, sticky rice, thai tea and thai iced coffee.  The total bill was $64!!!  $64 for a complete meal with soup, appetizers, sticky rice, drinks and noodles is pretty dang good!  Not only that, but the dishes weren't dinky and were plentiful!  The Thai Tea and Thai Iced Coffee also came in huge glasses. So much that my parents didn't finish their drinks and had to take it to go.  I'm used to a very fat bill with small portions every time I visit a Thai restaurant back home in California, so $64 looked great to us.

2. GREAT FOOD:  Not only was the place very affordable for a Thai Restaurant, but it was amazingly delicious.  BEST CHICKEN LAAB/LARB I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE! (From a restaurant, that is.  I still think Mom & Bro-in-law makes the best larb in the world).  It was a perfect combination of salty and sour.  I find that some restaurants make it too salty or don't add enough of that larb stuff..... rice powder/toasted rice powder.  I immediately tasted a hint of rice powder and asked my mom if she did too... just to confirm it.  They also added just enough cilantro and greens to add that fresh herb taste to it.  Everything was in perfect unison.  It was just damn PERFECT!

Everything else was great; Tom Yum Soup was flavorful, seafood salad was fresh, pad thai was also delicious and the sticky rice was heaven!  It was kept in a bamboo warmer and had that home quality taste just like the way Grandmas makes sticky rice.

We ordered a 4 spicy on a scale of 1-10 and it was just perfect.  It was pretty spicy for a 4, but it was just about right.  We got our pepper kick without totally burning off our tongues.  I come from a family that eats spicy food, so I recommend asking for 3 or lower if you can't really take the heat.  

3.  GREAT SERVICE:  I was put in charge of searching for restaurants to go to during our trip, so initially, I was thinking about taking my parents to a more fancier, ""Best Thai Restaurant in the Country"" place.  But last minute, I decided on Archie's because of the reviews that stated this place was a small, family owned restaurant.  Knowing my parents' preference and my own as well, I knew we would enjoy the food and atmosphere of a small restaurant.  The 2 waitresses were super friendly and often checked back on our tables to see if we needed anything else.  They also came back around to refill our water twice.

The only negative about Archie's is that it's away from the strip.  It's not too far, but its a few miles.  Also, the restaurant is located on a very dark shopping center.   The shopping center was deserted and.... kinda creepy.",2009-02-25,Las Vegas,-115.2309704,36.1148157,"['Restaurants', 'Thai']"
5,Rock Lobster,"Let me first say I've read a lot of reviews about the service. I've never gone to Rock Lobster for the teppanyaki so I cannot speak to that experience. However, the few times I have been there for lunch and dinner we were greeted by several people when we came in, our drinks were refilled regularly, the waiters asked if we had any questions about the menu, and they were happy to provide recommendations when we asked. I have never had a problem with the service. In fact, I've experienced a friendly, inviting environment. 

On an unrelated note, I recently discovered Rock Lobster's bento box lunches and I'm thrilled. They are affordable, fresh, and the perfect amount of food. So now this is also a favorite place to grab lunch. And I didn't mention this in my last review but I really like the unisex bathroom set-up. More places need to incorporate that into their design.",2016-01-15,Chandler,-111.8840725,33.2611752,"['Restaurants', 'Sushi Bars', 'Japanese', 'Asian Fusion', 'Teppanyaki']"
4,Monsoon Thai Cuisine,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Monsoon before now, given how much we enjoy dining here - not least because it's within walking distance from our home, which makes for a nice last-minute dinner option when the cupboards are bare and we don't feel like driving to the store. 

The staff are always very sweet and willing to accommodate special requests, like my insistence for extra vegetables in whatever I'm ordering. They WILL make it super spicy if you are specific about asking for it - one time I received a dish of curry that looked like half a jar of chili pepper had been stirred into the sauce. Yowza! 

Their entree offerings are flavorful (anything with basil or Kaffir lime leaves is especially worth getting), varied, and typical for what you expect from a decent Thai place. I love pretty much any of the curries, and the option to order squid as your meat of choice is a nice addition to the usual beef/chicken/shrimp/scallop lineup. The Thai Iced Tea is a big winner with my husband - too sweet for me, but I always steal a sip regardless. Serving sizes are substantial - you could easily split a dish if you and your dining partner wanted to eat the same thing, but it'd also work very well if a group of friends wanted to order a few different things to serve up family-style.

Prices range on the slightly higher side for dinner fare (again, typical for what I've seen in other Thai restaurants), but their lunch menu is really bargain-priced. Most of Charlotte seems to know it, too, because it's always HOPPING during the times I've visited mid-day. Later in the evening, business seems to slow down - several times, my husband and I have been the only people in the restaurant. 

Honestly, we've not tried any other Thai restaurants in Charlotte yet, because we like this one so much and it's so close to home. Maybe we're missing out...but it sure doesn't feel like it.",2013-03-05,Charlotte,-80.8668329,35.199336,"['Restaurants', 'Thai', 'Vegetarian']"

5,La Brioche True Food,"I really can't believe that I'm saying this, but I think Brioche has knocked out my #1 and is my new favorite restaurant in Madison. Come here for a true dining experience; you won't be disappointed.

We went for brunch and it was pretty busy, but we didn't have to wait for a table. I got the mushroom omelet and my friend got the veggie benedict. Both were tasty, as were the greens that came with it and the soup we got as an appetizer.

We had to try something from the bakery too, so after asking our waitress for her recommendation, we took a morning bun to go (they're known for them). Also great.

The thing that gets me about this restaurant is that it's not a dinner (or a lunch, brunch, etc.); it's an experience. Everything in the place has been thought out and made as comfortable as possible. For example, the entire restaurant has been designed with feng shui concepts (and is explained in a little book on the table!), they serve reverse-osmosis water that's made onsite, and they have table lamps at the smaller tables.

Seriously, Brioche, A+. I will be back again VERY soon.",2013-05-28,Madison,-89.4383460521,43.0753535306,"['Breakfast & Brunch', 'Pizza', 'Restaurants', 'American (New)']"

3,The Kennedy Public House,"I have been to the Kennedy Public House eight times for lunch, each time with an entire table of mom's with strollers and young babies. The staff have been very accommodating to all our gear and our (sometimes) noisy children. 

They have pizzas, meal-sized salads, sandwiches, and full entrees. I have had the steak and tomato salad three times, and each time it arrives a bit differently with meat of varying doneness.  They serve fried artichokes on top, which is perhaps the best part. 

Avoid the steak sandwich unless you want to eat it with a fork and knife, the meat is far too thick for chewing through and attempts at it make for a disgusting show of mastication for your dining partners.  The mac n cheese with dried porcini mushroom is a miss in my books - i felt like i had drank a cup of cream after - not enough depth of flavour.

He wanted something to eat/drink, I wasn't hungry but thought a place with the word ""italian"" in it, located in Dilworth on East Blvd, would have some decent coffee. I didn't realize it's a chain. We sit down at a table outside on the patio. Waiter comes up and I'm about to ask him about espresso drinks when he cuts me off and says something along the lines ""we just have regular American coffee, nothing fancy."" First of all, espresso is not fancy. Second of all, when you call yourself anything ""Italian"" and you don't have espresso you are a fraud. So needless to say after this ignorant waiter managed to piss me off by implying I'm pretentious for wanting ""fancy"" coffee I didn't get anything, my dad got one drink and we left. Also, some other table near us was just getting their pizza as we were leaving and it looked like awful, medium-thick crust, flavorless, frozen pizza. From the reviews on here that sounds about right. Seriously, just call the place ""bad American pizza.""

3,Bea Taco Town,"NOTE- this review is for the new Banksville location which does not have a yelp page as of yet.

Yesterday, I visited the brand brew Bea Taco Town located on Banksville road for their grand opening. I was originally intrigued to go as I had heard so many good things about their downtown location and because they had a sign stating that items were 50% off during their opening. 


I arrived around 1:30pm for lunch and it wasn't quite busy at that time, but did start to fill up as I was eating. Actually, by the time I left the entire place was full (there are two sides a small area with seating and also a larger main area). 

In general, the service was very fast and friendly and the food was okay- I had chicken enchiladas with red sauce and a side of rice and refried black beans. The beans were my favorite part and everything else was just okay, as mentioned. Not great, not bad,  just okay. Although, My fiancé had chicken and steak street tacos and he said he really enjoyed them and they were very fresh. 

The restaurant itself seems to be a mish mash of items from the previous restaurant that has been repurposed with new (bright orange and green) paint. Although, this eclectic type style may be what they're going for so I'm  not knocking them. 

One thing I didn't like was that the menus were paper copies that were handwritten, so it made it very difficult to read and interpret. I wish they would have just typed something up and printed those out. 

Overall my experience here was again just okay. Nothing bad happened but I wasn't really blown away. Finally, when the bill came the only items that were 50% off were the street tacos, not my meal, so I thought the sign they had out front was a bit contradictory. If you're going to run specials on select items you need to be more specific so that people's expectations of what they are paying is clear.",2016-02-28,Pittsburgh,-79.9973231,40.4424229,"['Restaurants', 'Mexican']"

5,Paul's Spaghetti,"Excellent food! Pretty good service.  Once when we went here for dinner we had to wait quite long for our main courses to arrive, other then that, I highly recommend this restaurant.

Everything is pretty much homemade...you can certainly tell from the taste.  My SO has had the Spaghetti w/Meatsauce which is(was) his favourite...it no longer appears on the menu(the last time we were there), but they now only offer Spaghetti w/Meatballs...which is also very good.
I've tried the gnocchi once and it was good but my favourite dish is the Rigatone w/Spinach (vegetarian), it is served with a creamy pesto sauce, onions(not a lot), spinach, goat's cheese crumbled on top and toasted pine nuts.  The first time I tried this, I thought I had died and gone to heaven--seriously!!  It is very rich and creamy, which I like and I love pasta.

I also recommend the house salad with a homemande vinagrette dressing to start, and they also bring you fresh baked warm bread w/butter.

Most (if not all) of the desserts are homemade...some on the premises and some offsite...I overheard the server talking to another table.

The patio is great in the summer.  The restaurant itself is quite small but a cozy, relaxing atmosphere.  I don't recommend bringing children here though...

5,The Capital Grille,"My husband and I went there for Valentine's dinner. Food was terrific and the service was excellent. We had an amazing night. 

Starting with the fresh oysters, they are so fresh that I can taste the ocean. My husband doesn't like raw food but he ate 3. With that kind of quality for only $18 for half dozen, it's totally worth the price. 

Calamari was crisp. I was surprised it can be tasted that good with the hot peppers. Must try!

Steak tartare, a little bit dry but not too bad. I had better :)

Lobster crab cakes, not too special. $20 for only 2 pieces, I think you can skip it.  
 
We had the rib eye for main course, and the steak cooked to perfection with the fries on the side. One of the best steaks in town.

Also like their wine list. We ordered half bottle of red wine and it's enough for 2.

5,Phat Phrank's,"Excellent! Another bookmark down.

This review is long overdue. I had lunch here almost a month ago and I could not stop raving about it to coworkers when I got back. The experience is still fresh in my mind. I had the daily special Fish Tacos, but I asked for flour tortillas instead of corn. Everything was made fresh, and the slaw on my tacos was TO DIE FOR. The creamy sauce was perfectly seasoned and the fish was fresh and tasty. The rice wasn't mushy - it was cooked perfectly. My husband had a chicken burrito and he could not get over the salsa - he said it was the best salsa he had in his life.

Nestled behind a gas station and some heavy road construction, Phat Phrank's is a jewel in the rough. It's perfect for a power lunch, or maybe picking some to-go food when you just don't feel like cooking. 

As I sat there one random Friday afternoon, I had seen people from all walks of life come in and out happy. There were suits, construction workers, Louis Vuitton ladies, and families either dining in or picking up to go orders.

Frank was there during my visit and couldn't have been nicer. He made sure to talk to every customer and made sure everyone was enjoying their meal. He's super helpful when you're trying to figure out what you should order. I asked him why they weren't open on weekends and he had said they were once, but business wasn't worth a 7 day schedule. He did say once the construction on sunset was completed, they would definitely be open Saturdays again. 

Fresh food, great service, reasonable pricing - this place is an easy 5 stars.
As the unfortunate duchess of a certain Roberto's, I can proudly tell you that this place is definitely worth stopping by and checking it out !",2013-06-11,Las Vegas,-115.206889,36.072516,"['Mexican', 'Restaurants']"

The food was decent, had the Vegas fries for an appetizer-which were spicy but in a good way and a nice decent portion. I ordered the brisket nachos which were awesome, however my boyfriend and his friend each ordered a sandwich and they were both small and left lots to be desired.

My problem with this restaurant was the service. It was slower than I've ever had, well ever. We asked for waters which didn't arrive until after our appetizer was half eaten (about 30 minutes from when we sat down) and we wanted to order alcoholic beverages but we barely saw our server after we ordered our appetizer and meals. What should have been no longer than an hour lunch took almost 1.5 hours by the time we were able to get our server to come over to pay the bill and even longer to get our change.",2016-05-06,Las Vegas,-115.1726,36.118793,"['American (New)', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Burgers', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Bars', 'American (Traditional)', 'Pubs', 'African']"
4,Midwood Smokeshack,"I visited the original Midwood on Central and both times I gave it a crappy review. 
Recently this location was opened near me and I thought I would give it a shot. 
This time I tried the pulled pork and she had ribs.(Other times I had brisket)
The portions were a good size, a bit pricey, but expected in this area, 
The pork was cooked well and had nice texture and was fairly moist, but did lack smoke flavor. Overall not bad. The sides...beans were good, had some meat in them with onions and a nice flavor. The mac and cheese was ok, but not great. Kinda lacking flavor, but still edible. The ribs were good, not great, but a nice portion for a half rack. 
The service, not table side, was confused. I guess they are still learning. The people behind the counter seemed not sure what to do and were kinda falling over themselves. They ran out of mac and cheese and we had to wait til it came out of the oven. 
Overall, better that previous experiences. I really wish yelp allowed 1/2 stars cause they were a little better than 3, but I'll go a four since they are new as a benefit of the doubt on the service.",2016-10-23,Matthews,-80.7286189869,35.0829585488,"['Beer Bar', 'Bars', 'Sandwiches', 'Barbeque', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants']"

I have frequented places that will happily ""do you dirty"" and not mention when something isn't part of their special to jack up the price of the bill. Food was pretty decent. Only complaint is that it was super dark in there.

4,Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak,"I was here on business and a group of 8 of us were there for dinner.  The dinner rolls were delicious...loved the rock salt on top of them.  The butternut squash soup is incredible!  I would highly recommend that to start.  I also had the watercress and cucumber salad which was also delightful and a nice light start to the meal.  I ordered the rack of lamb...rare.  It was incredible.  I did notice it was a little on the fatty side, but the cut was nice and big and it was so delicious, that no matter how full I felt, I had to finish it.  The table got quite a few sides...assorted mushrooms, pureed sweet potatoes, fingerling potatoes, asparagus and potatoes au gratin.  I wasn't a huge fan of the fingerling potatoes...it was just baked and lacked flavor.  The pureed sweet potatoes were my favorite with the asparagus a close second.  For dessert, you must get the Monkey Bread.  That was absolutely incredible.  I wasn't too fond of the pairing with the Brown Sugar Sour Cream ice cream, but a good vanilla ice cream would be great with the monkey bread.  The ambiance is great although I would do without the paintings of cows with a steak cut written on it.

I do think the place got off to a rocky start in terms of service, but I think they have a handle on it now. The only reason I have to knock off a star is because the atmosphere is kinda lousy. I want to feel proud bringing my friends here, but instead I'm like, ""Pay no attention to the boring decor, the food is good."" After all this time, I feel they should be able to remedy the look of the place by now.

3,Barrio,"They've got some typical new-restaurant issues with service;  my friend and I were handled by three different waiters/waitresses upon getting in there, which was a little disconcerting.   They all did alright, but it seemed like they were a bit panicky and overwhelmed, even though the restaurant wasn't full.  

The free chips and sals are definitely a plus.  The chips appeared to be house-made, and the salsa didn't taste like it was made of soup kitchen castoff veggies.  I was impressed, and I think between the two of us, we went through three bowls.  

I ordered chorizo tacos and fried fish tacos.  The chorizo was as expected (good and greasy with a healthy kick), but the fish tacos were great.  The batter wasn't too thick, and it didn't feel overcooked.  Yes, everything wasn't delivered to the table piping hot, but honestly, I'll have it that way instead of ""oh god why is my palate bleeding?"" hot.

Not fast food, but not a full on site down fancy restaurant. Meat was very good. Wasn't a huge fan of the potato salad, not sure what it was about it. Not terrible, but will not get it again.

4,Rosie McCaffrey's Irish Pub & Restaurant,"Oh boy was I excited when I first walked into Rosie McCaffrey's.  An Irish pub right down the street?  This place was a godsend disguised as a local drunken hotspot.

Apparently, it wasn't disguised at all.  It really is just a local drunken hotspot.

I've been a moderate patron of Rosies for the past few months now, and while this is my usual watering hole of choice, there are a few things that need to be said about it.  First of all, the beer selection is good.  It isn't Yardhouse by a longshot, but the choices are varied for different tastes and income brackets.  The food is good for bar fare.  I felt much like a Irish local grazing the fields of greasy confections, I could literally feel my alcohol tolerance increasing with each bite.  The service is good, but prepare to wait if the place fills up (which it does) and you'll get looked over if you don't have cleavage (which I don't) but it helps if you're on a first name basis with the staff (which I am).

The music is varied, which is nice.  On the nights where live music is playing, you'll get a spattering of Irish folk music or recent covers.  I'm a fan of a few bands that play there, but to be completely honest, there have only been a few occasions where I've found my toes tapping.  But it's lively and fun, pleasant to listen to while you inebriate yourself.

You'll find a wide range of characters that frequent Rosies, though.  From the bar rats, greased woman hunters, drunken floozies, haughty better-than-alls and down home boys, there is never a lack of people to talk to.  I can't guarantee a good experience, but who can?  But I wouldn't worry, if you're using the place as you should, you won't remember tomorrow morning anyway.

No matter it's flaws, Rosie McCaffery's is worth a visit at least.  Grab a bite, take a shot of Irish courage and mix it up with a stranger.  If you see a fellow standing to the side, people watching with a silent amused smirk, come and say hello.  I probably won't bite.",2007-12-19,Phoenix,-112.061446347,33.5094076522,"['Irish', 'Restaurants', 'Nightlife', 'Pubs', 'Bars']"

Although a chain, they did have both from San Tan Brewery and Four Peaks on tap. Two of each. A solid plus to the usual bud, bud-light, coors, coors light sameness.

The server acting as the host was patient with our indecision on where to sit and very friendly. The atmosphere was lively and welcoming. 

My co-diner ordered a beer from the fairly large list and I ordered a glass of red wine; we were both pleased. And the food! I had the steak feature--a baseball sirloin with truffle butter and red wine jus accompanied by asparagus and frites. My steak was cooked perfectly (emphasis!) which isn't always the easiest with that cut and melted in my mouth. Both the asparagus and frites were solid too. It was a steal at $21. Co-diner ordered the burger feature and was also really impressed and enjoyed the house tomato-jalapeno jam. 

The excellent service and positive atmosphere lasted throughout the meal. The staff seem to really enjoy working there and ensuring patrons have a good experience.
