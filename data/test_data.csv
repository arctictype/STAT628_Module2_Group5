1,McDonald's,"Seriously cannot stand this McDonald's. They NEVER get my order right. Food almost always sucks! Service is sorry! The employees sure do show they hate their jobs in the way they perform at work! I used to work at McDonald's as a teen getting through high school, don't remember that McDonald's ever taking so long in a drive-thru or being bitter about the fact I worked there! Lol And to top it all off, this is the McDonald's I live right across the street from :( so I find myself here more often than not! ugh! Get it together people! You guys are terrible! I honestly don't have anything nice to say about this place... I usually wouldn't review a place just to talk mess, but I waited at the drive-thru for 15 minutes this morning to get two coffees!!! Standards back when I worked there was a minute or less for each car!",2014/12/29,Glendale,-112.2050201,33.5095967,"['Burgers', 'Fast Food', 'Restaurants']"
5,Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak,"Amazing food, truly excellent best lobster bisque, and the prime rib, probably the bedt Ive had!!

5,Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant,"This was my second time here, and the seafood was just as awesome as I remembered! We got the King Crab & Lobster Dinner package. It comes with a soup, king crab cooked in 3 different ways (steamed, friend with dry garlic, and fried rice), HK style lobster (the lobster tower you see in all the photos), snow peas, and dessert. This package is meant for 4 people, and is $288 pre tax and tips. However, because all their king crabs were larger than the size that comes with this package (4.5lb), we had to pay additional for the extra weight. I think the amount of food that we got could probably have fed a party of 6. I love the fried lobster and crab legs here, both are super yummy! This restaurant is definitely worth a visit for any seafood lovers!

However, the restaurant does get very busy. So make sure to call ahead and make a reservation, esp if you plan on coming during the weekends! The tables in the restaurant are packed very tightly. The round table I was at was literally touching the table beside us. So don't come here if you are expecting a restaurant with a nice ambiance, or a place where you want to talk to your friends in private. Because the table beside you will definitely hear every word you are saying!",2015/11/24,Toronto,-79.30079543,43.82423358,"['Seafood', 'Restaurants', 'Chinese', 'Live/Raw Food']"
1,Bonjour Brioche,"Long story short.

Bunch of rude, heartless, and ignorant assholes run this place with no compassion for people especially people they feel do not belong or are suitable for their shitty establishment. 

My mother endured an extremely humiliating situation at Bonjour Brioche. She went in on a Saturday to wait for 45 mins with her cane, with nowhere to sit while she waited for her friend. A number of people who were waiting after her were seated before her, and she asked when she would get a seat until her friend arrived. She'd like to have a coffee while she waited. 

Basically was told, your friend's not here; tough shit no seat you can wait. She asked well what if my guest cancelled last minute and I would like to eat alone. Are you not going to serve me even if I sit and have something alone? 
they then started to tell her that they get that excuse all the time and that she could not get a table until her friend arrived. 

As she asked for the manager, her friend arrived at the same time. She explained to the manager that she's been waiting with her cane, hasn't been given a table and that people after her had been seated even if they were waiting for others. She felt demeaned and didn't appreciate the service and that she would be taking business somewhere else. Instead of the manager making some arrangement to ease the situation she told my mother that she can leave now. 

I have never in my life had my mother call me and cry on the phone of how humiliated and embarrassed she felt.

4,Dilly's Deli,"We grabbed some dinner here last night before catching a show at Gammage. 

We were the ONLY people in this place, yet the staff acted like they were slammed, very short with us and it took quite some time for our order to come out.

The food was good, though the bread bowls that the soup came in tasted like they were a few days old, very dry and crumbly vs the normal super fresh tasting bread bowls you get here.",2010/9/28,Tempe,-111.9453653,33.4221754,"['Caterers', 'Sandwiches', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Delis', 'Burgers', 'Restaurants']"

1,The Good Egg,"Me and wife have been going to the good egg since 2010, and this good egg since it opened.  This use to be our favorite place, close to home, gym and good food.  However, they have really gotten worse and worse for the past few months.  The service is hit and miss, the wait staff his also hit and miss.  We went on sunday march 6 and had to wait for food for over 30 minutes, food was cold and did not taste as good as usual, and the service was the worse.

I got the pastrami on rye (I felt the need to add the ""on rye"" when I ordered because I wasn't sure, being this is Vegas, if they might try to serve it on Wonder Bread), and while it's certainly not the best deli I had had, it will do in a pinch.

3,Anjappar Chettinad Restaurants,"I saw this restaurant on a whim when I was looking for a good indian food place to try and decided that this was the one. We opted for delivery because why not.

I usually judge the place based on my all time favourite Butter chicken and when I got it for sure this place has it down! It surpassed the other ones I tried and for sure this is where am getting it from now on.

Aside from that dish, we also got the chicken tikka masala and the garlic naan bread. The masala was alright, I tasted a better one elsewhere so this one wasn't really my favourite from them. And the garlic naan was yummy. Really generous with the garlic for sure. 

And I also got a Mango lassi, I didnt like their version that much so I think I'll skip on this one next time.

Anyway, I have yet to try their other dishes in the future so for now am just giving them three stars. And also the other reason for the rating was because our food arrived late. Am glad I waited a little bit more because I was close to complaining. But other than that, food is decent and I would order from them again.",2016/5/17,Mississauga,-79.6419661,43.5995957,"['Indian', 'Buffets', 'Halal', 'Restaurants']"
5,The King's Kitchen,"In town for a conference and checked Yelp for great local spots to eat. This place was recommended by the hotel staff and Yelp reviews only reinforced their recommendations. 

Atmosphere was great. Packed, but got seated quickly. Service was very friendly and suggested a couple specials. I had the pork chop dinner....it was incredible. The chop was so juicy. The polenta was great, and the glaze sealed the deal. Top 3 best meals of all time!! Im serious. 

The $9 house salad was disappointing (bland, no salt n pepper or flavor) with a ranch dressing that didnt come close to the flavor of ranch, more like a creamy herb I couldnt identify.  But I tell you, the pork chop meal completely made up for it. 

My colleagues got the gumbo and said it was really good, as well as the fried chicken. I very well may go there again tomorrow because it was that good!!",2014/10/16,Charlotte,-80.844322,35.227757,"['American (Traditional)', 'Restaurants', 'Southern', 'Bakeries', 'Food']"

Easily one of the best sushi places on town with a good atmosphere and good service.

Best things to eat/ recommendations:
1. Sashimi salad.  This thing was amazing.  A nice pile of salmon, yellowtail, and albacore with sweet cucumber and shrimp. 

2.  Be happy roll: surprise crunch inside a savory tuna, salmon, avocado roll.

3.  The shit.  This appetizer acts like as stuffed jalape??o but without the super spicy kick.

2,Gia Lai,"Like many other Yelpers, I stopped by with my Mom and sister for a late lunch and walked into a entirely empty restaurant. That always puts me on high alert since it's usually not a good sign. 

I ordered the beef pho, my sister got the chicken pho and my mom got the glass noodle chicken soup. We also tried the spring rolls and the crab rangoon. The spring rolls were just okay, but the crab rangoon I found to be super-greasy. And I've ordered this dish from some pretty seedy take-out places. It's never tasted that strange. My mom's soup came out with shrimp and some weird pork in it and had to be sent back. When dining with two other people, all eating soup, well... that's just unfortunate since cold soup isn't appetizing and eating while you're hungry mother waits isn't fun either.  My pho was just okay. My favorite pho spots in CLE blow what they served me out of the water, but it was edible. 

The server was very apologetic, but overall I just didn't find the value there for the quality of food you actually get. 

I will say they serve up some damn good, fresh limeade and sparkling limeade!",2014/11/24,Lyndhurst,-81.50037713,41.50313561,"['Restaurants', 'Vietnamese', 'Asian Fusion']"

I felt like I was on Fear Factor doing the 2nd challenge!  The worst part is that becuz there are so few Chinese food places in Pickering, people are tricked into thinking that spicy dragon is the best.  It breaks my heart.

We also got their flour-less chocolate cake togo & ate it for breakfast the next morning w/our coffee. Yum.

3,Momofuku Noodle Bar,"My friend and I went to Momofuku for dinner during their first opening weekend. Thank goodness we arrived 20min before opening since there was already a line up when we got there. We managed to get a seat right at the windows which was a little awkward considering the fact that people outside can watch you eat.

 I read a number of reviews and opt to go for the Momofuku ramen, the rice cakes, the pork buns, and the Slushie. I thought the ramen was alright but nothing to rave about. I did like the pork belly that was used in it. The rice cakes were great! They were chewy and had the right about of hotness to it (compare to the ones you would get at Korean places where it was just too hot!). The best part was the pork buns. The pork belly was so moist and tender and the bun was just so soft. I would definitely go back there for them. 

The Slushie was interesting. It was both hot/sour and really hits you when you first take a sip of it. Really not for those who don't like hot/sour tastes.
 
Overwall, I thought the Noodle Bar was good even though the ramen wasn't that impressive. But the prok buns did win me over and I wouldn't mind going back there to try the others.

This place recently opened and our server was very attentive and took the time to explain the menu to us. He strongly favored the halibut tacos and said they were his single favorite thing on the menu so I ordered them. 

I need to note we were here for lunch so this is only a lunch review based on just one visit.

I soon received them and they were I think the most figure friendly meal I ever had out. Aprox. three oz. of halibut between two lettuce leaves (instead of tortillas) , pickled onion , Mexi style tomatoes , avocado , radish,  some crunchy greens and a very mild sauce. This plate was a bit on the mild side for my taste but maybe the intention of the dish was to taste the fish and not to over power it. This plate came with a side of black beans that were seasoned and had some flavors going on. This seemed like a very healthy meal to have out. I also liked that they used halibut and not something like muddy catfish or tilapia.

My husband tried the Charcuterie. It was sort of like an around the world kind of plate. It had five kinds of meat , a Chinese Sausage, a Hungarian Sausage, Italian Meats, Fig Jam, Toast, whole grain mustard, pickles, olives and a wedge of Brie Cheese.

I noticed an interesting Connecticut Style Steamed burger on the menu that you just don't find too often that might have been fun to try. Someone seated next to us got one and I thought it looked good.

3,Ciao Wine Bar,"I came here with high hopes for the Summerlicious menu. We started with the orecchiette though I should have ordered salad. It was a very generous portion for an appetizer and, along with the bread, filled us up quite substantially before we got to the ravioli. The ravioli was hearty, but also a bit heavy. The sauce and cheese filling made for a really filling meal. By the time we got dessert, I was stuffed and could barely finish it. The espresso tart was very rich, though it lacked a particular delicacy. 

The restaurant was quite full when we arrived and they initially seated us on the corner near the stairs, which was not at all a pleasant spot, but before we got settled in, the waiter found us a better table. I really enjoyed the ambiance -- enough lighting to see the food but not too bright. The food was served gradually, allowing us ample time to talk and catch up. The one catch was probably that splitting the bill at the end of the meal was weird, as the waitress rounded up from half of the total, which isn't good practice.

Overall I would say that the ambiance outdid the food. I was expecting something a little more delicate and less like what I can make for myself at home. It was worth a try though as I'd gotten a really good impression from the website and other reviews. I would probably not return unless something on the regular menu caught my eye.",2014/7/18,Toronto,-79.3936453,43.6704754,"['Wine Bars', 'Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Italian']"
5,New York Flavor,Tried this place cause it was highly rated on yelp. It did not disappoint. I had the Basil Marscapone burger. My son had the special Deniro Burger.

2,Copacabana Brazilian Steakhouse,"Pros:
The food was fantastic and the gentlemen walking around with the various steaks and meats were attentive. The dancers were energetic and a ton of fun to watch. A clean, aesthetically pleasing restaurant to dine in. 

Cons:
We saw our waitress a total of 3 times in the 2 hours that we dined there. Once to take our original drink orders, once more to refill our drinks after we bothered another waitress when we were thirsty, and last when we were paying our bill with a different server (perhaps a floor manager?) to ""thank"" us. I don't know about other diners but my husband and I need more than one or two glasses of water to tide us over with that rich of a meal. We try our best to be easy guests but it was a little annoying to sit and watch other tables be tended to all night (other diners seeing their servers 5-9 times in their dining experience) with us sitting there never seeing our server again. I don't know if it was her fault or the restaurant's for stretching her too thin but it was incredibly frustrating. 

For $50 a person (making a two person bill easily $150 with tax and tip), the service was ridiculous. I can go to a bar and spend less than $20 with my husband and get better service and feel more welcome than we did here.",2016/4/18,Toronto,-79.38783098,43.64834408,"['Bars', 'Restaurants', 'Nightlife', 'Brazilian', 'Barbeque', 'Steakhouses']"

I ordered the redneck club which has both pulled pork and brisket on it, along with some slaw...So, basically all of my dreams came true. And then I ordered the ghost pepper mac n' cheese as well. It is super spice and even more so when you add the inferno that is the ghost pepper bbq sauce. I loved it!

3 star because of its 'generous meat portions' -

Someone explained the entire menu and the restaurant concept (order and pay at the counter first and you help yourself to condiments, drinks, and utensils) when I sat down.  Two people came by halfway through our meals to see if everything was okay as well.

The food.  We had hummus with pita to start.  I love hummus so this was no different.  The portion is pretty small though so I probably wouldn't get it again.  We got the full pack share platter.  It came with the MOST oily delicious garlic bread.  Remember to eat these before they get cold and hard.  The large side of veggies was SMALL and flavoured poorly.  It also mainly had onions in it which weren't really cooked through so I didn't enjoy this at all.  The mash potato on the other hand great!  ok so the chicken.  It was pretty moist and had lots of flavour.  But I was hoping the skin would be crispy and instead it was kind of soggy. Who doesn't love eating crispy chicken skin right?!

However, our amazing waiter was extremely helpful coming up with gluten free options for me.

I did tell them to leave off the green onions, but they forgot that, which was a little disappointing, considering they had no other orders then. The Karaage fried chicken and takoyaki balls were delicious and really nice to split between friends actually. 

Price-wise, it was $11.75 for the combo, which is a little higher than most lunches at ramen joints, but they include a side dish and drink along with it, so I suppose it balances out a little more.

Then, the waitress came back and did not apologize at all but simply said that he had to pick a different beer because they were out of that one.

Our waitress was polite... a bit absent at times.  Didn't really affect the meal though.

The house salad dressing a creamy tomato basil dressing was pretty good.  At first I almost defaulted to ranch, but our server listed all of them off.

The portions are big, and the prices are  proportional to the dishes.  I'd say it's a solid 3-star that I want to give 4 to, but nothing really wowed me about my first visit.",2011/8/24,Charlotte,-80.70846296,35.17198483,"['Restaurants', 'Italian']"

Fresh Guacamole made table side allows you to have it made spicy or mild, your choice. Husband and I chose the street tacos. You choose any three out of 6 different tacos and served with rice and beans. Friend ordered the chicken enchiladas and her husband ordered the carne asade bowl. The green sauce on the enchiladas was good but spicy! The bowl was huge and tasty. Also order the grilled corn as it is the bomb! The corn is sweet and juicy and the coating is salty and slightly cheesy. Ended the meal with the flan. All four of us shared one as we were all stuffed but had to try it.

There were several different kinds of sandwiches to choose from. I got the chicken salad and it was delicious. Everyone else really liked their sandwiches too. The salad was also really good. Not your typical garden or Cesar salad. I'm not quite sure what it was but it had chicken, tomatoes, and feta.. yummy. Now we must also discuss the huge dessert platter that was in front of us. It was filled with chocolate covered strawberries, brownies, cookies dipped in chocolate, and more! I've never seen a dessert try like that before for a work lunch. Of course, I had to try a few of the items and they were all so good!

I would definitely make my way to their physical location in the future so that I can try out some other items.

I can't give a full review exactly, since I've only ordered with other people from work and not picked anything up personally or seen the inside, BUT - seriously some of the best Thai I've ever had. The first time I ordered, I got tofu and string beans. Vegetables weren't steamed to mush, and tofu was still firm. The sauce was perfect - curry with just a little spice. 

I've also ordered their coconut soup - which is by far my favorite. Again, I wasn't the one making the order, but from what I heard they were super friendly, and definitely accomodating- they gave me tofu instead of the meat at no extra charge. The coconut wasn't overpowering, but it was just enough to smooth out the tang of the lime.

The bartender, some girl with Little Mermaid red hair, was too busy flirty with the older gentlemen at the bar. After sitting for 20 minutes without so much as a greeting we flagged her over. I don't come here too often and can't remember the wine on the menu I like. I'm certain there is one I really don't like so I asked if I could try a taste of two. She was instantly annoyed, the look was apparent on her face. She brought over two tastes and left, not to return for another 13 minutes; at this point, I was timing. We ordered drinks, she brought them and then left the bar. She was then gone, just completely absent. 

We had to flag her down one of the servers to get the tab, paid and walked out. The service was terrible. You'd get better service(and food!) at a Taco Bell or McDonalds.",2016/12/2,Phoenix,-112.0375021,33.50757235,"['American (New)', 'Southern', 'Seafood', 'Barbeque', 'Restaurants']"

They have one of the most extensive and impressive wine lists that I have seen in a while - but they have a knowledgeable wine steward who can help you ferret out a nice selection.

I'm not a vegetarian, but I do try to eat healthily.  That generally means, more veggies, less fat, less meat, more whole grains, more organic food...  Sadly, that often limits lunch choices to grilled chicken salads.

Tree Hugger's has lovely, lovely soup, great vegetarian and chicken (with fruit!) salads.  I recently had the black bean chimichanga-- black beans, rice and sweet potato in spices wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla and grilled.  It wasn't meat and it wasn't fried, yet it still managed to taste fantastic!  The chicken salad wrap is delish, but it really does need salt.  (I actually appreciate that, though, because most places over-salt everything.)

Fear not the vegan cookie!  Vegan baked goods are usually disgusting.  Sorry guys, but that brownish lump of oats, hemp seeds, coconut and carob is just not appealing.  Tree Huggers has somehow managed to make vegan cookies that are as desirable as plain old cookies!!!  I had a carrot ginger cookie-- think of a light carrot cake with an orange ginger glaze.

I settled for a slice of pepperoni and mushroom and a drink, all for $4.50.  The slice was enormous, plenty for a late dinner (pre-drinking meal) and the crust was perfection.

OMG you have to have the Hama Chili, Crackling Calamari, Tuna Poke and Sunshine Roll. I love spice but when you pair it with grapefruit, anyone can take the heat on the Hama Chili. The Crackling Calamari isn't your vanilla appetizer you find elsewhere. Amidst the crispy tentacles, you have a treasure trove of Asian mushrooms, cabbage and crunchy textures that spoil your tastebuds. And if that isn't enough to have you lusting, the Tuna Poke is amaze balls. I love the rice crackers because it's the only way to ""permissibly"" allow you to scrape the bowl without looking like you lack etiquette. To cleanse your palate of the explosion of happiness erupting in your mouth, the Sunshine Roll is an delish crowd pleaser and closing for your tasting. For someone with a linebacker appetite, I have to admit I was very happily content. Happy belly happy face!!!!

From all the various Buddhas to the chainlink bathroom entrance, I love the setup because it immediately invites you in with the shimmering lights dancing above the bar and the dark decor to be flirtacious. And who can resist a big Asian DJ spinning the best 80s tunes as you down your cold saki to forget the hot days of summer ahead. Definitely making another trip back and will check out happy hour with my entourage. You will not regret it!!!

5,Archi's Thai Kitchen,"This place deserves 5 stars based on these 3 things:

1. AFFORDABLE PRICE: My parents, sister and I visited this place on a Sunday night while visiting Vegas for the weekend.  We ordered soup, pad thai, chicken larb, seafood salad, stuffed chicken wings, sticky rice, thai tea and thai iced coffee.  The total bill was $64!!!  $64 for a complete meal with soup, appetizers, sticky rice, drinks and noodles is pretty dang good!  Not only that, but the dishes weren't dinky and were plentiful!  The Thai Tea and Thai Iced Coffee also came in huge glasses. So much that my parents didn't finish their drinks and had to take it to go.  I'm used to a very fat bill with small portions every time I visit a Thai restaurant back home in California, so $64 looked great to us.

2. GREAT FOOD:  Not only was the place very affordable for a Thai Restaurant, but it was amazingly delicious.  BEST CHICKEN LAAB/LARB I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE! (From a restaurant, that is.  I still think Mom & Bro-in-law makes the best larb in the world).  It was a perfect combination of salty and sour.  I find that some restaurants make it too salty or don't add enough of that larb stuff..... rice powder/toasted rice powder.  I immediately tasted a hint of rice powder and asked my mom if she did too... just to confirm it.  They also added just enough cilantro and greens to add that fresh herb taste to it.  Everything was in perfect unison.  It was just damn PERFECT!

Everything else was great; Tom Yum Soup was flavorful, seafood salad was fresh, pad thai was also delicious and the sticky rice was heaven!  It was kept in a bamboo warmer and had that home quality taste just like the way Grandmas makes sticky rice.

We ordered a 4 spicy on a scale of 1-10 and it was just perfect.  It was pretty spicy for a 4, but it was just about right.  We got our pepper kick without totally burning off our tongues.  I come from a family that eats spicy food, so I recommend asking for 3 or lower if you can't really take the heat.  

3.  GREAT SERVICE:  I was put in charge of searching for restaurants to go to during our trip, so initially, I was thinking about taking my parents to a more fancier, ""Best Thai Restaurant in the Country"" place.  But last minute, I decided on Archie's because of the reviews that stated this place was a small, family owned restaurant.  Knowing my parents' preference and my own as well, I knew we would enjoy the food and atmosphere of a small restaurant.  The 2 waitresses were super friendly and often checked back on our tables to see if we needed anything else.  They also came back around to refill our water twice.

The only negative about Archie's is that it's away from the strip.  It's not too far, but its a few miles.  Also, the restaurant is located on a very dark shopping center.   The shopping center was deserted and.... kinda creepy.",2009/2/25,Las Vegas,-115.2309704,36.1148157,"['Restaurants', 'Thai']"
5,Rock Lobster,"Let me first say I've read a lot of reviews about the service. I've never gone to Rock Lobster for the teppanyaki so I cannot speak to that experience. However, the few times I have been there for lunch and dinner we were greeted by several people when we came in, our drinks were refilled regularly, the waiters asked if we had any questions about the menu, and they were happy to provide recommendations when we asked. I have never had a problem with the service. In fact, I've experienced a friendly, inviting environment. 

On an unrelated note, I recently discovered Rock Lobster's bento box lunches and I'm thrilled. They are affordable, fresh, and the perfect amount of food. So now this is also a favorite place to grab lunch. And I didn't mention this in my last review but I really like the unisex bathroom set-up. More places need to incorporate that into their design.",2016/1/15,Chandler,-111.8840725,33.2611752,"['Restaurants', 'Sushi Bars', 'Japanese', 'Asian Fusion', 'Teppanyaki']"
4,Monsoon Thai Cuisine,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Monsoon before now, given how much we enjoy dining here - not least because it's within walking distance from our home, which makes for a nice last-minute dinner option when the cupboards are bare and we don't feel like driving to the store. 

The staff are always very sweet and willing to accommodate special requests, like my insistence for extra vegetables in whatever I'm ordering. They WILL make it super spicy if you are specific about asking for it - one time I received a dish of curry that looked like half a jar of chili pepper had been stirred into the sauce. Yowza! 

Their entree offerings are flavorful (anything with basil or Kaffir lime leaves is especially worth getting), varied, and typical for what you expect from a decent Thai place. I love pretty much any of the curries, and the option to order squid as your meat of choice is a nice addition to the usual beef/chicken/shrimp/scallop lineup. The Thai Iced Tea is a big winner with my husband - too sweet for me, but I always steal a sip regardless. Serving sizes are substantial - you could easily split a dish if you and your dining partner wanted to eat the same thing, but it'd also work very well if a group of friends wanted to order a few different things to serve up family-style.

Prices range on the slightly higher side for dinner fare (again, typical for what I've seen in other Thai restaurants), but their lunch menu is really bargain-priced. Most of Charlotte seems to know it, too, because it's always HOPPING during the times I've visited mid-day. Later in the evening, business seems to slow down - several times, my husband and I have been the only people in the restaurant. 

Honestly, we've not tried any other Thai restaurants in Charlotte yet, because we like this one so much and it's so close to home. Maybe we're missing out...but it sure doesn't feel like it.",2013/3/5,Charlotte,-80.8668329,35.199336,"['Restaurants', 'Thai', 'Vegetarian']"

5,La Brioche True Food,"I really can't believe that I'm saying this, but I think Brioche has knocked out my #1 and is my new favorite restaurant in Madison. Come here for a true dining experience; you won't be disappointed.

We went for brunch and it was pretty busy, but we didn't have to wait for a table. I got the mushroom omelet and my friend got the veggie benedict. Both were tasty, as were the greens that came with it and the soup we got as an appetizer.

We had to try something from the bakery too, so after asking our waitress for her recommendation, we took a morning bun to go (they're known for them). Also great.

The thing that gets me about this restaurant is that it's not a dinner (or a lunch, brunch, etc.); it's an experience. Everything in the place has been thought out and made as comfortable as possible. For example, the entire restaurant has been designed with feng shui concepts (and is explained in a little book on the table!), they serve reverse-osmosis water that's made onsite, and they have table lamps at the smaller tables.

Seriously, Brioche, A+. I will be back again VERY soon.",2013/5/28,Madison,-89.43834605,43.07535353,"['Breakfast & Brunch', 'Pizza', 'Restaurants', 'American (New)']"

I had the Veggie My Shu with fried rice. It was huge and absolutely the best Mu Shu ever. My husband had Sweet and Sour chicken and he loved it. He can be a bit picky about Asian food and this place was a hit. The service was wonderful, everyone was very friendly. I loved the open kitchen concept.

They have pizzas, meal-sized salads, sandwiches, and full entrees. I have had the steak and tomato salad three times, and each time it arrives a bit differently with meat of varying doneness.  They serve fried artichokes on top, which is perhaps the best part. 

Avoid the steak sandwich unless you want to eat it with a fork and knife, the meat is far too thick for chewing through and attempts at it make for a disgusting show of mastication for your dining partners.  The mac n cheese with dried porcini mushroom is a miss in my books - i felt like i had drank a cup of cream after - not enough depth of flavour.

He wanted something to eat/drink, I wasn't hungry but thought a place with the word ""italian"" in it, located in Dilworth on East Blvd, would have some decent coffee. I didn't realize it's a chain. We sit down at a table outside on the patio. Waiter comes up and I'm about to ask him about espresso drinks when he cuts me off and says something along the lines ""we just have regular American coffee, nothing fancy."" First of all, espresso is not fancy. Second of all, when you call yourself anything ""Italian"" and you don't have espresso you are a fraud. So needless to say after this ignorant waiter managed to piss me off by implying I'm pretentious for wanting ""fancy"" coffee I didn't get anything, my dad got one drink and we left. Also, some other table near us was just getting their pizza as we were leaving and it looked like awful, medium-thick crust, flavorless, frozen pizza. From the reviews on here that sounds about right. Seriously, just call the place ""bad American pizza.""

3,Bea Taco Town,"NOTE- this review is for the new Banksville location which does not have a yelp page as of yet.

Yesterday, I visited the brand brew Bea Taco Town located on Banksville road for their grand opening. I was originally intrigued to go as I had heard so many good things about their downtown location and because they had a sign stating that items were 50% off during their opening. 


I arrived around 1:30pm for lunch and it wasn't quite busy at that time, but did start to fill up as I was eating. Actually, by the time I left the entire place was full (there are two sides a small area with seating and also a larger main area). 

In general, the service was very fast and friendly and the food was okay- I had chicken enchiladas with red sauce and a side of rice and refried black beans. The beans were my favorite part and everything else was just okay, as mentioned. Not great, not bad,  just okay. Although, My fianc?? had chicken and steak street tacos and he said he really enjoyed them and they were very fresh. 

The restaurant itself seems to be a mish mash of items from the previous restaurant that has been repurposed with new (bright orange and green) paint. Although, this eclectic type style may be what they're going for so I'm  not knocking them. 

One thing I didn't like was that the menus were paper copies that were handwritten, so it made it very difficult to read and interpret. I wish they would have just typed something up and printed those out. 

Overall my experience here was again just okay. Nothing bad happened but I wasn't really blown away. Finally, when the bill came the only items that were 50% off were the street tacos, not my meal, so I thought the sign they had out front was a bit contradictory. If you're going to run specials on select items you need to be more specific so that people's expectations of what they are paying is clear.",2016/2/28,Pittsburgh,-79.9973231,40.4424229,"['Restaurants', 'Mexican']"

Everything is pretty much homemade...you can certainly tell from the taste.  My SO has had the Spaghetti w/Meatsauce which is(was) his favourite...it no longer appears on the menu(the last time we were there), but they now only offer Spaghetti w/Meatballs...which is also very good.
I've tried the gnocchi once and it was good but my favourite dish is the Rigatone w/Spinach (vegetarian), it is served with a creamy pesto sauce, onions(not a lot), spinach, goat's cheese crumbled on top and toasted pine nuts.  The first time I tried this, I thought I had died and gone to heaven--seriously!!  It is very rich and creamy, which I like and I love pasta.

I also recommend the house salad with a homemande vinagrette dressing to start, and they also bring you fresh baked warm bread w/butter.

Most (if not all) of the desserts are homemade...some on the premises and some offsite...I overheard the server talking to another table.

The patio is great in the summer.  The restaurant itself is quite small but a cozy, relaxing atmosphere.  I don't recommend bringing children here though...

5,The Capital Grille,"My husband and I went there for Valentine's dinner. Food was terrific and the service was excellent. We had an amazing night. 

Starting with the fresh oysters, they are so fresh that I can taste the ocean. My husband doesn't like raw food but he ate 3. With that kind of quality for only $18 for half dozen, it's totally worth the price. 

Calamari was crisp. I was surprised it can be tasted that good with the hot peppers. Must try!

Steak tartare, a little bit dry but not too bad. I had better :)

Lobster crab cakes, not too special. $20 for only 2 pieces, I think you can skip it.  
 
We had the rib eye for main course, and the steak cooked to perfection with the fries on the side. One of the best steaks in town.

Also like their wine list. We ordered half bottle of red wine and it's enough for 2.

5,Phat Phrank's,"Excellent! Another bookmark down.

This review is long overdue. I had lunch here almost a month ago and I could not stop raving about it to coworkers when I got back. The experience is still fresh in my mind. I had the daily special Fish Tacos, but I asked for flour tortillas instead of corn. Everything was made fresh, and the slaw on my tacos was TO DIE FOR. The creamy sauce was perfectly seasoned and the fish was fresh and tasty. The rice wasn't mushy - it was cooked perfectly. My husband had a chicken burrito and he could not get over the salsa - he said it was the best salsa he had in his life.

Nestled behind a gas station and some heavy road construction, Phat Phrank's is a jewel in the rough. It's perfect for a power lunch, or maybe picking some to-go food when you just don't feel like cooking. 

As I sat there one random Friday afternoon, I had seen people from all walks of life come in and out happy. There were suits, construction workers, Louis Vuitton ladies, and families either dining in or picking up to go orders.

Frank was there during my visit and couldn't have been nicer. He made sure to talk to every customer and made sure everyone was enjoying their meal. He's super helpful when you're trying to figure out what you should order. I asked him why they weren't open on weekends and he had said they were once, but business wasn't worth a 7 day schedule. He did say once the construction on sunset was completed, they would definitely be open Saturdays again. 

Fresh food, great service, reasonable pricing - this place is an easy 5 stars.

The food was decent, had the Vegas fries for an appetizer-which were spicy but in a good way and a nice decent portion. I ordered the brisket nachos which were awesome, however my boyfriend and his friend each ordered a sandwich and they were both small and left lots to be desired.

My problem with this restaurant was the service. It was slower than I've ever had, well ever. We asked for waters which didn't arrive until after our appetizer was half eaten (about 30 minutes from when we sat down) and we wanted to order alcoholic beverages but we barely saw our server after we ordered our appetizer and meals.

Recently this location was opened near me and I thought I would give it a shot. 
This time I tried the pulled pork and she had ribs.(Other times I had brisket)
The portions were a good size, a bit pricey, but expected in this area, 
The pork was cooked well and had nice texture and was fairly moist, but did lack smoke flavor. Overall not bad. The sides...beans were good, had some meat in them with onions and a nice flavor. The mac and cheese was ok, but not great. Kinda lacking flavor, but still edible. The ribs were good, not great, but a nice portion for a half rack. 
The service, not table side, was confused. I guess they are still learning. The people behind the counter seemed not sure what to do and were kinda falling over themselves. They ran out of mac and cheese and we had to wait til it came out of the oven. 
Overall, better that previous experiences. I really wish yelp allowed 1/2 stars cause they were a little better than 3, but I'll go a four since they are new as a benefit of the doubt on the service.",2016/10/23,Matthews,-80.72861899,35.08295855,"['Beer Bar', 'Bars', 'Sandwiches', 'Barbeque', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants']"

I ordered the rack of lamb...rare.  It was incredible.  I did notice it was a little on the fatty side, but the cut was nice and big and it was so delicious, that no matter how full I felt, I had to finish it.  The table got quite a few sides...assorted mushrooms, pureed sweet potatoes, fingerling potatoes, asparagus and potatoes au gratin.  I wasn't a huge fan of the fingerling potatoes...it was just baked and lacked flavor.  The pureed sweet potatoes were my favorite with the asparagus a close second.  For dessert, you must get the Monkey Bread.  That was absolutely incredible.  I wasn't too fond of the pairing with the Brown Sugar Sour Cream ice cream, but a good vanilla ice cream would be great with the monkey bread.

3,Barrio,"They've got some typical new-restaurant issues with service;  my friend and I were handled by three different waiters/waitresses upon getting in there, which was a little disconcerting.   They all did alright, but it seemed like they were a bit panicky and overwhelmed, even though the restaurant wasn't full.  

The free chips and sals are definitely a plus.  The chips appeared to be house-made, and the salsa didn't taste like it was made of soup kitchen castoff veggies.  I was impressed, and I think between the two of us, we went through three bowls.  

I ordered chorizo tacos and fried fish tacos.  The chorizo was as expected (good and greasy with a healthy kick), but the fish tacos were great.  The batter wasn't too thick, and it didn't feel overcooked.  Yes, everything wasn't delivered to the table piping hot, but honestly, I'll have it that way instead of ""oh god why is my palate bleeding?"" hot.

4,Rosie McCaffrey's Irish Pub & Restaurant,"Oh boy was I excited when I first walked into Rosie McCaffrey's.  An Irish pub right down the street?  This place was a godsend disguised as a local drunken hotspot.

Apparently, it wasn't disguised at all.  It really is just a local drunken hotspot.

I've been a moderate patron of Rosies for the past few months now, and while this is my usual watering hole of choice, there are a few things that need to be said about it.  First of all, the beer selection is good.  It isn't Yardhouse by a longshot, but the choices are varied for different tastes and income brackets.  The food is good for bar fare.  I felt much like a Irish local grazing the fields of greasy confections, I could literally feel my alcohol tolerance increasing with each bite.  The service is good, but prepare to wait if the place fills up (which it does) and you'll get looked over if you don't have cleavage (which I don't) but it helps if you're on a first name basis with the staff (which I am).

The music is varied, which is nice.  On the nights where live music is playing, you'll get a spattering of Irish folk music or recent covers.  I'm a fan of a few bands that play there, but to be completely honest, there have only been a few occasions where I've found my toes tapping.  But it's lively and fun, pleasant to listen to while you inebriate yourself.

You'll find a wide range of characters that frequent Rosies, though.  From the bar rats, greased woman hunters, drunken floozies, haughty better-than-alls and down home boys, there is never a lack of people to talk to.  I can't guarantee a good experience, but who can?  But I wouldn't worry, if you're using the place as you should, you won't remember tomorrow morning anyway.

No matter it's flaws, Rosie McCaffery's is worth a visit at least.  Grab a bite, take a shot of Irish courage and mix it up with a stranger.  If you see a fellow standing to the side, people watching with a silent amused smirk, come and say hello.

Although a chain, they did have both from San Tan Brewery and Four Peaks on tap. Two of each. A solid plus to the usual bud, bud-light, coors, coors light sameness.

The server acting as the host was patient with our indecision on where to sit and very friendly. The atmosphere was lively and welcoming. 

My co-diner ordered a beer from the fairly large list and I ordered a glass of red wine; we were both pleased. And the food! I had the steak feature--a baseball sirloin with truffle butter and red wine jus accompanied by asparagus and frites. My steak was cooked perfectly (emphasis!) which isn't always the easiest with that cut and melted in my mouth. Both the asparagus and frites were solid too. It was a steal at $21. Co-diner ordered the burger feature and was also really impressed and enjoyed the house tomato-jalapeno jam.

4,Asian Legend,"I imagine ordering at Asian Legend for the first time is kind of like casting out a fishing net and seeing what you get...

They do some of the pseudo Chinese dishes though it's not their specialty, so if you're looking for Chicken w Cashews, Fried Rice, Sweet & Sour, etc, you may not be impressed.

But they do some ""Northern"" Chinese dishes consistently well which is hard to find in the city, even one as multicultural as Toronto. I say ""Northern"" Chinese but to me this type of food has always just been Chinese food but with so many different styles of Chinese food I guess they've had to define it as ""Northern"". Northern in this case I assume refers to Beijing though they have a wide selection of traditional Chinese dishes.

Now I'll be honest, I've had better food in Asia and if you're a purist then I'm afraid you'll not find a adequate substitute here but I've taken many people here from all cultures and they've always been happy with the food.

Plus they're one of the cleaner places in Chinatown which helps if you're entertaining and it's a fun place to bring larger groups and eat family style affordably. Tables of 10 welcome!

If you're looking for things to order here are my recommendations in order of amazingness:

Steamed pork soup dumplings (we usually come here just for this dish)
Rolled Onion Pancake with Sliced Beef
Sauteed Green Beans with Dried Shrimp (but I always ask for garlic instead of dried shrimp, I think they've actually changed it to garlic but haven't updated the menu)
Stir Fried Ho Fun w Beef
Moo Shu Chicken
Shredded Pork w Sweet Peking Sauce
Fried Tofu
And they do a decent peking duck which is always fun if you're with larger groups.

These are super safe dishes for those who are new to Chinese food. I'd imagine that if you're not, you'll probably know what to order on your own.

I've just realized that I usually go with non-Chinese people so I've actually not tried some of my favourite Chinese dishes like Dong Po Pork, Shredded Chicken w Noodles, Beef Noodle Soup, and Braised or Sauteed Eggplant. 

I'll have to make a point to try them next time and update accordingly... stay tuned...",2011/3/12,Toronto,-79.3951973,43.6538619,"['Restaurants', 'Dim Sum', 'Chinese']"

now about the food....the sushi was good.  not the best, but it was good.  i really like that staff there. super friendly.  when you do AYCE, they let you order whatever you want, made however you want.  if you feel like extra masago, you can get extra masago.  if you want spicy mayo on sashimi with a lemon wedge, you can do that too.  you get the drift.  

you know how some AYCE places pack on the rice on their rolls and sushi, this place doesnt.

I am not one to seek out Vegan/Vegetarian cuisine, however, I was pleasantly surprised with my meal. The menu was more than overwhelming, there are so many choices! I ended up ordering the Chipotle Bacon Burger (that's tempeh bacon), adding avocado and aged cheddar cheese. The burger itself is huge, so $11.50 for the burger is decent. However, my add-ons were $2 and $2.25 respectively, so in the end, I had ended up spending the most money I had ever shelled out for a burger; and this one didn't even have meat in it! I think I will visit again but I don't feel like this place is worth the price. At least not to a meat lover like myself.",2015/3/7,Toronto,-79.4034837,43.6667324,"['Vegetarian', 'Restaurants']"

Ordered a regular maple waffle as well as a regular waffle topped with caramel and vanilla ice-cream. Delicious! 

The place sells sandwiches too, but waffles are what it's known for. The shop is small and cozy. There's no place to sit, and even the standing room is very cramped. There's usually a small line leading into the shop. Waffles are made fresh. An impatient man asks you what you want, and then throws the mix onto a waffle grill.

I was introduced to Rosati's at their store on Thomas in Central Phoenix.  They had a good variety of menu items, appitizers, ribs, fish and chips, fried shrimp, salad, sandwiches and pizza and pasta.  Then when my daughter and I stayed at a local hotel and didn't feel like going out, their store in Awhatukee delivered right to our hotel room door! Their pasta is always cooked to perfection.....my daughter loves her spaghetti with butter.  They give you a generous hunk of garlic bread with it.  I love pizza.....and this pizza was unique to me the first time I had it.  A thin crust, cut in squares, with the toppings covered by a layer of cheese.  YUM!  Apparently this is another type of Chicago style pizza.  Their toppins are quality!  The sausage is delicious!!  It's got the right amount of spices and that gives it a nice flavor.  So tonight I decided to try something a little different.  I ordered their ""double dough"" pizza.  It's a thicker crust but not a super thick crust.  The edges are thicker than the regular pizza they serve.  This was the BOMB DIGGITY!  I had sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms and roasted red peppers and that was an awesome combination.  I also had the freshest ceaser salad I have had in a while.  Friday night is pizza night at our house and this one will be in the rotation for sure!

Well, maybe not so hidden since we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table even with a reservation, but this place really does look like a ""hole in the wall"".  I've been to Vegas several times and had never heard of this place even though it was steps from the strip.

The decor is kind of cheesy, but the service was impeccable and the food was absolutely delicious.  And seriously, all you can drink wine, garlic bread, soup/salad and side of pasta with every entree for under $30??   That's one of the best deals anywhere, let alone Vegas.

I got the sauteed salmon... the fish was really fresh and the sauce on it was delicious.  Tried bites of a lot of my friends pasta dishes.  Absolutely everything I tried was outstanding.  I really wasn't expecting much of the food... I kind of thought this was going to be more of a cool experience than anything else.  I was very pleasantly surprised.

4,Five Guys Burgers and Fries,"Five Guys is definitely a unique fast food experience. 

When you walk in, the restaurant is very open. I personally really like that. However,
some people (my other half) don't like the openness. It lacks privacy. It's more of a cafeteria style dining room setup. It's reminiscent of a mall food court.

I think that Five Guys has a really efficient system to making their food, which leads to few screw ups. Big plus. You can see the entire process of your food being made from start to finish. This reflects the transparency of Five Guys. They are open and transparent about everything. That's their gimmick - that there is no gimmick.  You order at the register and pick up on the other side after it's done. Food can take a little longer to come up than most places, but that's because they're making everything fresh. 

Their burgers are made fresh of a good quality beef. This isn't your ordinary fast food burger. The toppings are always fresh. There's a sign that tells you the farm where today's potatoes for the french fries come from. The french fries are (obviously) fresh cut (they literally keep their dated sacks of potatoes in the dining room). They're also fried in peanut oil, which gives them their unique flavor. Most places avoid peanut oil because of the common and deadly peanut allergy (obviously if you have any serious nut allergies, this place is not for you). But the peanut oil gives the fries a little something different that you can't get most places. They also offer Cajun seasoning for the fries. They're alright, but lack luster. They're more of just a hot spice than a flavorful spice, which disappointed me.

The food is definitely greasy, which puts some people off, but what would you really expect from a place like this? It's served in a brown paper bag, and your fries will be everywhere. Be warned. For some people that's a major annoyance/turn off, but it doesn't bother me any. 

The staff is always very friendly and polite. They all always have smiles on their faces. 

The price is a little steep for what it is. That's what knocks it down to four stars instead of five for me. It's also nothing super unique or special. That's another reason to knock the fifth star off. But the food is fresh, and the employees are friendly. For most places that's half the battle. 

Helpful hint: a ""little"" burger is a single party. If you order a hamburger cheeseburger, it's going to have two patties.",2015/2/24,Pittsburgh,-80.17491893,40.44870835,"['Restaurants', 'Burgers', 'American (New)', 'Fast Food']"

Although they are both delicious, the healthy version ( a soft taco with seared ahi along with a kim chee-ish slaw) is my favorite. A great contrast of textures with pleasantly surprising bold flavors.  A very refreshing snack, one of the best fish tacos in town if you ask me.

2,Hogtown Smoke In The Beach,"I ordered the Carolina Pulled pork sandwich which came with your choice of 2 sides, I chose the mac and cheese and fries, as well as pig candy for delivery through Just-Eat. The sandwich said it came topped with coleslaw, I assumed there would be somekind of bbq sause on the actual pulled pork. But no, it was DRY. The taste was fine, but I've never heard of a dry pulled pork sandwich and I would have appreciated a note to inform me to choose the sauce separately. The coleslaw was fairly bland and soggy as well. The fries were almost black, soggy, and a few were actually under cooked. The mac and cheese was edible. The pig candy (chocolate covered bacon) wasn't good. The bacon itself was good, thick cut and cooked to chewy not cripsy, which is how I prefer it but the taste if the chocolate wasn't good and didn't pare well with the bacon. I realize that the delivery could have caused some of the sogginess but I doubt it. I get delivery often and am always trying new places, so I like to think I'm a pretty good judge of when the food itself is an issue and when it's the delivery process that causes the problems.

I was delighted to see that Amaya's served a roti which sounded delicious:  spinach, edamame, sweet potato and spicy mayo. I ordered samosas and pakoras which were pretty tasty. The roti though was a disappointment. I neglected to notice that it had said ""roti wrap"" so the ""wrap"" was just a tortilla wrap. Not a nice, chewy, light roti shell like they make at Ghandi's & Mother India. It felt like I was just eating an indian wrap sandwich. 
The filling tasted pretty decent so I might give this place another chance but try their curries.  I'm more inclined to just try the restaurants that I haven't been to yet in Little India because the prices are better there.
In the meantime, my craving for a Ghandi's/Mother India-style roti will go unsatiated boo hoo hooo!",2010/12/11,Toronto,-79.3323082,43.6627856,"['Food', 'Restaurants', 'Fast Food']"

4,Fired Pie,"I stopped in at lunch time after seeing this place on the ""new businesses"" section on the Yelp homepage.  The map seems to be off, this place is located next to the AMC 30 and Starbucks at the Deer Valley Town (Towne?) Center.  I was reluctant at first because the only other pizza joint like this I had tried before in North Phoenix (I forget the name) missed the mark pretty bad (over priced and not filling).

The set up is straight forward, any pizza or salad is $7.75.  They have a few pre-built options, otherwise you can build your own.  I went the build your own route and rattled off a few of my go-to toppings. There was plenty more options and it would be nice if there were labels or a cheat sheet as I might want to get a little more adventurous in the future. I didn't feel like being the ""what's that?...and that?...and that?"" guy.

The pizza itself took only a few minutes to cook and seemed to be just about the right size for a lunch portion (I could have saved a bit for later but was exceptionally hungry). The staff was very helpful and friendly, and after reporting back to folks at the office I'm sure I'll be returning sometime in the near future.",2013/8/26,Phoenix,-112.124353,33.666693,"['Italian', 'Restaurants', 'Salad', 'Pizza']"

The appies of crab cakes were good and the carpaccio was also good. The special main course of scallops were ok nothing special (would eat again but don't crave for it). The dessert of lemon meringue ice cream sandwich was pretty and tasty according to my friend (I don't like meringue). But what turned us off big time was that the service was good until the moment you're done eating and then it became a passive aggressive act until we left. I haven't seen my friend in almost 2 months so we were catching up and talked after our meal. We didn't ask for the bill but it came immediately. We didn't pay yet but a lady came to stand next to our table with the machine. I asked if she can split the food so half on everything except dessert on my friends bill. She looked like she didn't understand so I elaborated. Eventually she says, ""so. You want separate bills?"" With attitude After I spent 2 minutes explaining the definition of what separate bills means and what goes onto what. She comes back and we pay and still give the appropriate tip. Then we continue to talk and I finished my glass of water but my friend hasn't. The lady comes takes my one glass away. I've been looking at the entrance there were NO ONE waiting. Yes it was busy maybe 90% full on a Saturday evening. Anyway then 5 mins later she comes picks up my napkin. Then my friend finishes her water and the server came to take her one glass. Then later lady comes back to take her one napkin. Again we stayed 20-30 mins after our meal was done and there were no one in line. with the price and ok food I would say it's an ok but nice restaurant but after this service post meal, we won't come back and don't recommend that you do either, there are too many nicer seafood places in Toronto.",2017/1/17,Toronto,-79.3887615,43.7049064,"['Restaurants', 'Seafood', 'American (New)', 'Canadian (New)']"
5,Spinato's Pizza,"Mama Spinato's Signature Fresh Spinach Pizza is one of the most perfect meals you can find in the Valley.

Spinato's sauce is really what hits the spot. It's slightly sweet. The fresh garlic on this pizza catches you by surprise and keeps you coming back for more.

If I could give Spinato's an extra star, I would. And it would be for the following: If you eat in the restaurant, the pizzas are served on top of a cooling rack, on top of a pizza pan. This ensures proper air circulation to the crust. By the time you get to that last slice of pizza (and trust me, there will be no leftovers to speak of) the crust still holds up to the pile of fresh spinach which sits atop it!

I should have sent them back as they clearly were NOT made to order but rather were probably just sitting around under a heat lamp. The place was not busy, so there is no excuse. I ate them and got out, still hungry. Prices have gone up (fish tacos now are $2 and others are $1.25), which is understandable with all the hype. But to get full, you would have to eat at least half a dozen. Seriously, Rubios fish tacos, on special on Tuesdays for $1.50 are better, both taste-wise and money-wise.

I typically enjoy them okay, mostly around holidays or in a pie or simply baked, but these bad boys right here - they were delicious and I couldn't stop eating them.  I really also enjoyed the cabbage but would pass on the greens.

The fish was pretty good, not the best I have ever had but it was pretty tasty none the less. And I really enjoyed their pig feet, trotters, whatever you want to call them. They were very tender and soft. The fried chicken wings were on point.

My husband and I went there for our anniversary. Arrived there as the first patron. Perfect for picture taking opportunity (especially for the untouched bread, dessert, and a mound of butter.....yet). We were seated in the garden area, a bit more secluded and private. Loved the ambiance and the decor (call me cheesy, but I love anything purple). The service was impeccable. I knew right away what I wanted, Sixteen Course Degustation Menu, without even opening the menu. My husband ordered Four Course Menu. Still skeptical about how magnificent the food was, I was both nervous and excited.  I knew then why people pay such a top dollar to go this place when I ate the first thing they served, Le Caviar (Caviar on a fennel cream). Just the fist bite of it and I am a changed foodie.

4,Lager & Vine,"The pluses:
* The only place I know of in Medina to have valet (I could be wrong but I haven't seen it anywhere else since Thyme moved).
* One of the few places in Medina that takes reservations.
* The Caprese Salad was really good, and that's saying a lot for tomatoes in winter in Ohio.
* Some unique options on draft. Not often you find Victory Golden Monkey on tap around here.
* Entrees were yummy - I had a burger (it was huge!) and my fiancee had a seafood pasta. We both enjoyed the meal.
* Not overly pretentious. Lots of differently dressed people, atmosphere is nice (think: rustic), without being stuffy.
* Servers (bartenders and our dinner server) were friendly, had a good sense of humor, and made some solid recommendations.

The minuses:
*  If you DON'T have reservations, expect a long wait, especially since people are coming in droves to try it out. TIP: Seating in the immediate bar area (all the hi-top tables) is first-come, first served.
* If you don't valet, it may be a challenge to find a parking spot.
* Prices are not bad, but higher than others in this city. Remember, the first location is in Hudson, and everything is priced higher there. :)
* If you're out for a family dinner with kids, not sure this is the place, unless it's maybe a weeknight dinner.

Overall - I enjoyed it. I have a goal to avoid ""big chain"" locations this year at all costs, so I can see this being a regular addition to our restaurant location. I'm not going for 5 stars since the reservation/parking issue kind of irks me (essentially, if you don't have a reservation, they make one for you at a later time).",2014/1/20,Medina,-81.863411,41.139364,"['Wine Bars', 'Restaurants', 'Bars', 'Gastropubs', 'Nightlife']"

The prices are beyond reasonable, especially for downtown. I love getting grilled cheese and tomato soup. But, hands down, the best thing they serve is the Friday mac and cheese. I have never found mac and cheese anywhere that comes close.  First of all, the cheese is flourescent orange, and the burned pieces from the sides of the pan, if you are lucky enough to get a little, cooks into a sort of cheese jerky that is actually delicious!

3,Genghis Grill,"I'm really frustrated with this place.  It's one of my teenager's favorite places to eat, but my experience yesterday will keep me away for quite awhile.  We've eaten here many times because...

My kid loves buffets where he can pile up on the limited amount of foods he likes. For example, at sub sandwich shops, he only has meat, lettuce and cucumbers on his bread.  Boring!  At Genghis grill he piles on the meat and adds broccoli an almost no sauce. He loves the Udon noodles.  I like the place too.  I make a mess every time (meaning I mix all the wrong things together) but I'm happy to do it.  I think the food is really tasty in spite of my culinary challenges.

I love the idea of this place, with TVs all around, and a full bar.  Unfortunately the execution falls a bit short with the TVs too high near the ceiling to be comfortable to watch for even a meal's worth of time.  The only TV I could see yesterday had a ceiling fan right in front of it.  The drinks are pretty pricey too, so there's better places to hang nearby if you want to watch a game (which I wanted to yesterday).

Now on to the service...  I don't like these semi-service deals where they bring you drinks and your check.  Am I supposed to tip them the full 15-20% like a regular restaurant?  If so, WHY?  Anyway... the gal who helped us was really short with us when we showed her my Yelp discount on my phone.  Yes, I showed her when she brought me the check, but I checked in on Yelp when I finished eating.  I hadn't asked for the check, so I don't think she should have had any attitude.  Then the thing that really sealed the deal was that I forgot my leftover box on the table (yes, I'm to blame here) but I barely made it to my car in the parking lot when I discovered it.  I was maybe 10 spaces from the door.  I actually jogged back to the restaurant and went to my table and everything was gone.  Everything was thrown out in 2-3 minutes from getting up from the table.  I had more than half my meal in there (it was full) and nobody even tried to holler at me.  They could have seen me out the front door all the way to my car.  I'm pretty sure it was my server who did it too because I found her and asked and she said YES it's been thrown out.  She acted a little sorry but I think she was happy to have ""gotten me"" for pulling up a coupon late.  So I left pissed off.  I got to my car and decided to call the manager.  I got the number and got him on the phone.  To his credit he offered to make me a new meal, but I was already down the road and didn't want to get out in the AZ heat one more time.  I didn't want free food.  I feel like taking free foods discredits the complaint to some degree.  I want to be treated better in the future.  Hopefully he spoke to her.  Grrrr... still irritated the next day.

3,Monsieur B,"C'??tait notre 2??me fois ?? ce restaurant. J'en avais tellement gard?? un bon souvenir il y a un an... Mais  nous ??tions d????us... Il y avait deux grandes tables avec un souper de f??tes. Et ils faisaient TROP de bruit! Style bar sportif! Cris, tombola (!!!!), tapage sur la table! ??a d??truit toute l'ambiance d'un petit resto qui est cens?? ??tre charmant! Les serveurs s'excusaient mais ne pouvaient rien faire! Est-ce en m??me temps l'endroit pour accueillir ce genre d'??v??nements!? 

Venons au menu. Nous avons pris le menu 6 services. Je suis enceinte et j'ai demand?? au serveur s'il est possible de changer mes bouch??es de thon et saumon crus en autre chose. Parfait! Mais, le chef change les bouch??es pour TOUTE la table et on nous ram??ne des crevettes et des moules frites! Pas du tout original! C'??tait surtout un peut injuste par rapport aux 3 autres personnes avec moi! 

La soupe du jour ??tait brocoli et panais. Un d??lice! Bien relev??e et cr??meuse! Dommage qu'elle n'a pas ??t?? bien mix??e : des bouts de panais trop durs restaient en bouche... 

Mon entr??e ??tait tr??s bonne : gnocchi de courges. Le plat, pintade farci, ??tait une d??ception! ? part la polenta frite qui ??tait d??licieuse et les petits pois frais, tout ??tait moyen, voire mauvais. La pur??e fade, la sauce Mad??re trop acide, mais surtout la pintade, TROP grasse, je ne l'ai pas mang?? : apr??s avoir gout?? un petit bout que j'ai eu du mal ?? couper avec mon couteau, je l'ai laiss?? sur l'assiette... Le trou normand ??tait bon et bien rafraichissant. 

Le dessert, pana cotta, ??tait excellent! Je l'ai litt??ralement d??vor??! Les saveurs ??quilibr??s et la texture de la cr??me parfaite!

ambiance: 4 stars - was a bit loud for my preference. Definitely better on the dining room side than the bar side, but if there's a big group of people dining at a table, it gets louder than I typically like. also, good idea to make a reservation. 

service: 5 stars, just the right balance of attentive without interfering or being annoying. 

appetizers: 5 stars. we had the heirloom tomato salad and the chicken liver mouse. both outstanding. 

entrees: 4 stars. we had the Tagliatelle and the crispy chicken. both dishes i found a bit too salty. we both felt the appetizers were the winners over the entrees.

cocktails: 4.5 stars - delicious, but wish there was a larger menu.

The bartender walks away and I don't see him for another 5 minutes or so.     My iced tea was empty after two minutes and when I looked around for someone to give a refill.   Surprise.  No one is around.    I had to wait until my food arrived from it looked like a cook to get a refill from someone other than the bartender.   Of course with no ice in it.    Nice room temperature to it.   He also had to get me silverware. 
Frankly I was less than impressed with the service.    It wasn't until halfway done with my meal that the bartender comes by with a cup of ice and a spoon to tell me. The ice melts fast.    Gee.  I think it really melts fast when their is no ice in the refill cup too.   

I am only giving two stars for the food which I believe is 4+ stars.   I am going to stick with delivery and takeout.    If you want to get better service go next door to the Persian restaurant.

1,Hugo's Cellar,"I was walking along Fremont when I saw this place on yelp.

I came downstairs after grabbing a pint upstairs at the Chicago Brewing, I wasn't acknowledged by Richard right away, a couple that came in after me was seated first (I'll dismiss this because they likely had reservations and I did not).

The server Jean(Gene?) and his assistant and the food was top notch and attentive the whole evening.  my main issue is with the manager and host - Richard, who is a pompous bigot. I encourage if anyone has any issues with Richard to report it to the hotel management, I wouldn't be surprised if your skin is dark or if you're not as well dressed that he will tell you the tables are full from reservations or treat you similarly.

There are no restrooms in the restaurant, so you need to go out and to the casino floor, Jeans assistant gave me brief and accurate directions and I returned to find a fine glass of Moscato waiting for me which I ordered to pair with the escargot, which I might add was the best I had since Paris.

The salad was custom crafted and the rack of lamb was cooked exactly as requested

I tried to go to the bathroom a second time after getting my lamb, and then Richard blocked my way, he insisted that I must leave a credit card before leaving, even though I left and returned before, as well as I had left personal items, including my phone, in plain site on the table.  It was clear that Richard was profiling me because he thought I was of lesser class. 

I am absolutely insulted.

I gave my card frustratingly and returned to finish my meal, the hostess that seated me originally apologized for Richards behavior and ignorance, I asked Jean if Richard had a manager I could speak with but was told unfortunately that he was the manager and I had no point of escalation. Jean also apologized for Richards behavior, it seems I'm not the only one he mistreats.

I finished my meal, and I thought I would go to the floor quick and drop $5 in the slots while I let my dinner settle as my phone battery was low and I was catching a redeye out that evening, since I had plenty to drink already I brought my water, again leaving personal items on the table.  Richard again blocked me this time and insisted I must leave the glass, not asking where I was going or if I'd return, I felt like dumping the water on his head but unfortunately couldn't without possibly getting a customer wet.

When I returned, my table was cleared, obviously they don't want me eating their wonderful selection of dessert, and Richard had Jean's assistant clear my table, he apologized for this and I could feel it was sincere, I never received a single apology from Richard, hence the label pompous bigot.",2015/5/14,Las Vegas,-115.142535,36.16950173,"['Restaurants', 'Seafood', 'Steakhouses', 'American (New)', 'American (Traditional)']"

3,Tex Mex 2,"We needed margaritas. 

And boy did we get them! This place does great margaritas, in a range of different flavours (most of which I have sampled) and they're not too heavy on the tequila, so you don't up in the bathroom crying before 10pm.

There was a large(ish) group of us and I must say it was nice of them to accommodate us. It's not a big place! We took up two tables but thankfully, the staff had moved the tables so that we could all see each other. We ordered a sharing plate of nachos to start and they were delicious. Everyone commented on how, amongst the mounds of toppings, the butternut squash was an odd but tasty addition. For main I ordered the Tex Mex Burger. I was disappointed it didn't come with chips but the burger was really good and the sour dough bun in particular was lovely.

This would be 5stars but.....well, when a restaurant says they close at 10 I always assume that refers to the kitchen. This place actually tries to get you to leave at 10. By 10:10 we were feeling a little awkward but still had almost a full pitcher of margarita left. Then the waiter did something which goes against my (unwritten and constantly changing) 'restaurant rules.' He brought over the bill before we asked. I find this quite rude. He could have asked if we wanted the bill first! A minor thing but it would have made all the difference.

Then...he broke another two rules! We totted up the notes and coins and I brought the total up to him, I was paying by card so while we went through the motions I explained that I didn't realise the place would actually close at 10 and apologised for my oversight (it was about 20 past at this stage) he said it was fine but made a song and dance about how much work he still had left to do. Fine, message received. I handed him the cash and returned to my seat. When he hadn't brought the change after 10minutes we resigned to just leave, we'd intended leaving it as a tip anyway (maybe he'd heard us discussing it) but I made a point of 'asking if it was all there' (I'm Irish, I don't do full confrontation well) he said yes and gave me the thumbs up.

Now, this is getting very long, but between bringing over the bill, complaining about how much work he still had to do and not returning the change, I must say, this was not the kind of service I was expecting. In my opinion we weren't drunk, loud or obnoxious but past 10 pm everyone at the table was left feeling awkward to the extent that most won't be returning.

It's basically the same concept as Pieology, a make your own bar full of pizza toppings.  You can choose from the menu of pre-made pizzas or create your own pizza from the many toppings they have.  I really don't know how to differentiate this place from the bigger pizza chains like Pieology and Blaze Pizza, because honestly, they're basically the same thing.  I will admit that I did enjoy the pre-made pesto pizza they listed on the menu.  It had a pesto base (no tomato sauce) topped with mozzarella cheese and chicken and tomatoes amongst other things.

I initially walked by this place doing some sight seeing and thought it was this run down restaurant. I mean, with a sign outside that says, ""Best Chicken in Taiwan,"" what was I to think? How shocked I was when I looked it up online and read the reviews. I decided I had to try this Hot Star out. 

Stopped in around 1PM on a Friday. There were a few people inside already, and went up to the counter to order. The cashier told me they weren't open yet, but would be in ten minutes. Cut to 40 minutes later, when I finally ordered. Their menu is still extremely limited: regular chicken, crispy chicken, spicy chicken, fries, and a few drinks/juices. 

The restaurant is small and new, but poorly designed. There are maybe 10 seats in the place, with an entire wall covered in a wood paneled design - should have made more seating there. But it's a piece of chicken that you can walk with, so no big deal there. 

The chicken? It's huge. It's fried. It's crispy. It's delicious. Like other people have said, it is just a piece of fried chicken, so it's not something totally new.

My friend and I specifically came here to sit on the patio. Specifically. We let the front desk person know, who said it would be a 20 min wait and gave us a buzzer. No problem. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks and some apps.

Let's talk about the drinks and food first - it came out quickly, so we were off to a good start. However, the raspberry mojito tasted like watered down syrup without an ounce of alcohol. The second drink, Unusual suspect, a bourbon concoction was actually good - a glimmer of hope. The flatbread apps were... meh. 

Okay, 40 minutes later, our buzzer hadn't lit up so we asked one of the servers to follow up on our patio request. Never came back. Another 40 minutes later - we were done our food and drinks, and still no buzzing! In fact, our server just took the buzzer with her when she cleared our plates.

I was bummed. Really. Especially because I was treating my friend to her birthday and we just wanted to enjoy drinks on the patio.

They have a few sauces for you to pick from at the counter to put on your taco separately. 

Maybe I'm not a taco expert but I didn't find the tacos particularly special. I thought they were alright, has quite a bit of seasoning and really messy to eat lol, prepare to grab lots of napkins.

5,Social House,"5 stars across the board . . . My 5-star reviews are few and far between these days, particularly because many of the restaurants I've visited in the past few months have missed the mark in some way or another.  Social House provided that rare experience that combines the best of ambiance, food and service. 

The modern restaurant is visually stunning from the moment you first walk into the lounge area and then sashay up to the host table. We had made a last minute Open Table reservation on a Friday night, and we were seated as soon as we came in. I loved the set up of the restaurant. First, they put us in the back area, but it was a little too dark for my taste, so we asked if we could have one of the booths in the front section. They were so accommodating, and said we would love this new table as it gave us a view of everyone who parades by. And it sure did! I am 100 percent sure my husband was the oldest person in the restaurant, and even being 16 years his junior, I am about 80 percent sure that I was the next oldest. But it sure was fun people watching . . . bachelor and bachelorette parties galore with some of the most interestingly dressed and entertaining people gliding by us.

Our server was fabulous! The menu offers so many wonderful options and he helped guide us through the choices, pointing out the fabulous and steering us away from the ordinary. We started with the Yellowtail Jalapeno. Don't be put off thinking it might be too spicy . . . it's not . . . a perfect melding of flavors with the tender Yellowtail and the crunchy jalapeno in a cilantro soy base. Next up . . . the salmon tartare, which was my favorite. The combination of the fresh and silky salmon layered with wasabi cream and drizzled with citrus soy was heavenly . . . so much so that I ordered another just for myself while hubby was licking his chops -- literally -- the tender Kurabuta Pork Ribs smothered in a sweet soy glaze were falling off the bone. We then shared the Cod Bibb Lettuce Cups . . . while we loved the dish, we found this a little skimpy for the price with only two pieces. As I was getting quite full, I opted to order only the roasted miso eggplant which put the finishing touches on my great meal.. My hubby with his big appetite ordered the hangar steak with roasted shallots and more of that delectable wasabi cream sauce. From pig heaven to cow heaven!

Social House is totally a hip place, even for us not-so-hip middle-agers. We had a fantastic meal, conscientious service and ""free"" entertainment. No doubt we will make another trip to Social House on our next trip to LV.

4,Gusto 101,"The Good: Everytime I come here, it's with the intention to order their house wine. Yes, admittedly, the $1 per ounce had me sold when I first found out about it over the summer, but their food is another reason for saving my appetite so I can order one of their well prepared dishes.

Must seat yourself on their patio when it's good weather. It can get a bit loud and crowded inside on their busy nights. 

On my last visit, I shared the following:

- Tagliata di Manzo - flank steak was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and flavourings were lovely.
- Branzino alla Griglia - the mix of veggies and fish was well done. Sea bass tasted fresh and juicy.
- Green tea gelato - sweet ending to the the dinner.
- each had a glass of house wine - white always crisp and it was perfect for sitting upstairs on their patio. 


The Bad: The Green tea gelato would've been perfect if the cookie that came with wasn't stale.

Service really needs some improvement. While the ladies at the front who seat us have been generally helpful, the servers really can do for some more genuine smiles. I understand that this place gets busy pretty much every night, but waiting for someone to put in our order or in one instance, basically cutting off my friend when she was deciding on what drink to order by saying, ""I'll just come back when you've decided."" was a bit rude in my opinion.


The Overall: Service aside, the food and drinks were great. Reasonably priced for a resto in the King District and conveniently located so you can always hit up another bar/club after.


Revisit: This is my go to place for drinks especially since it opens till 1am on Fri & Sat. How can you argue with $1/ounce wine? I would try having a get-together in their celler room.",2013/9/21,Toronto,-79.40030934,43.64500213,"['Restaurants', 'Italian']"

The service was lovely and attentive, no complaints there.  I ended up ordering off of the summerlicious menu b/c some of the offerings looked delicious.

I started with the quinoa salad with apples and aged cheddar.  This was fantastic - completely exceeded my expectations.  For my main, I ordered a fried chicken dish with beet/cauliflower  salad and this spicy chili sauce.  It was SO spicy, which I enjoyed, but I can imagine it being way too hot for the average person.  The chicken was incredible.  The other 7 people at my table opted for the steak or fish, and many were jealous of my pick.  For dessert, the chocolate pot de creme with chili was a bit of a let down.  Could not taste the chili at all.

Their food can be a little pricey if you have more than two people ordering, but the quality makes up for it. Even though there is a wait, it's not long at all. But I'd much rather wait for good, fresh food, than greasy and fattening food. What's also good is if you're a Family Dollar employee, just show them your ID badge, and you get a discount.

4,Yummy Grill & Sushi,"Yummy Grill & Sushi surprised me... for a few reasons..

The name for one, since a name like Yummy grill & sushi would have caused me to run away in my local homeyelptown.

But this place is awesome, like me and the BF were saying that Toronto needs a Yummy Grill & Sushi bar. 

They offer fresh sashimi, and they specialize in rolls, as well as deep fried or baked rolls on top of everything else they offer. They seem to like the ponzu soy sauce quite a bit too, but it's not a bad thing.

Their roll names are pretty fanciful, such as Sex on the Beach (really good, I recommend), My Ex-Girlfriend, Romeo.. I know it sounds odd, but I almost burst out laughing when I heard a kid ask the waiter if he could have an orgasm roll... but it's good to know that they take their sushi rolls seriously. 

Their menu is fairly easy to navigate, we ordered their clam miso soup, which was meaty came loaded with clams, which added a nice meaty-ness depth to the miso soup, good value for $3.50

We started off with a Joy, bam-bam, and finished with the Sex on the Beach roll, all of which were fresh and extremely flavourful without being too much of one thing or another, you were able to taste everything they had put in to the roll and it wasn't too overly stuffed.

Another thing they have that i haven't seen anywhere else, was their flavoured-sake--- this stuff is good.  We ordered their sake sampler $7 for 3 decent sized glasses of sake, we were able to try fuji apple, plum and raspberry. I definitely liked their fuiji Apple one the best, and the BF liked the plum. The sake tasted like sake, but you get the aroma and the taste of the fruit at the same time, quite enjoyable and a steal $7. They, also, sell sparking sake too; which I didn't see until too late, but that is for next time...

Their black sesame ice cream is quite good, and isn't too sweet either. Perfect ending to pretty note-perfect meal.

Service is good and attentive.",2011/10/17,Las Vegas,-115.2524842,36.19476429,"['Japanese', 'Sushi Bars', 'Restaurants']"

Side dishes are good, about 5-6 varieties, the usual sprouts, kimchi, pancake, sweetened potato, radish and carrots. 

Prices here are just slightly higher than average. eg pork bone soup is around $8 instead of $5-6. 

Service here is really really slow. I've been here four times and every single time, it seems like only one person is running the floor. Do not come here if you are in a rush. You'll become super irate.

The lounge seemed pretty cool too, the bartenders were hustling about pouring beer and joking with guests sitting at the bar.

The restaurant is nicely separated from the bar and completely smoke free.  There are TV's in the area so you can watch your sports game during your lunch or dinner.

They have a large menu ranging from simple appetizers to full course Surf and Turf meals.  The Stromboli is obviously my favorite.

The establishment is really clean and the staff is really friendly.  It doesn't get that busy so service is always there to fill your drinks.  

They have a full bar so you can order any drink you want.  Gaming is also available here.",2013/11/8,Las Vegas,-115.2164008,36.0298322,"['Burgers', 'Nightlife', 'Lounges', 'Restaurants', 'Bars']"
4,Mesa Grill,"Went for brunch/lunch on a Saturday at 2:30 pm.

Black Widow Mojito - WOW, great cocktail.  I can't wait to make it on my own... but I don't think it will ever turn out that good.

Grilled salmon - great presentation and flavor with sauces on plate... I think it was a really good poblano sauce.  Excellent flavor and loved the tomatillo salsa on top of the fish.  Note to self (or whoever wants to listen): order fish well done.  I ordered mine medium this time and it was a little too underdone in the middle for my tastes.

Sophie's Chopped Salad - eh, I could take it or leave it.  Big chunks of cheese in the salad and the dressing was good but not OMG good.

Pork tenderloin sandwich - OMG good.  Spicy sauce with expertly seasoned and tender pork, great bread.

Roasted beet and grapefruit salad - EXCELLENT.  

Service was great for us, but that is such a subjective thing because someone two tables over from us was hard-core bitching.  They had ordered appetizers, ate the appetizers, then put their order for lunch in and were whining because they saw that we had gotten our salads before their lunch order came out.  Wah, cry about it.  The manager came over and handled that little situation, but we were not disappointed with the service whatsoever.  Our server's name was Miguel, and he was really a very good server.  He made some great recommendations, which I always appreciate, and was, in general, pretty darn smooth.

For me, this is definitely a repeat.  I would love to do it again.",2008/9/2,Las Vegas,-115.1747927,36.11712457,"['Tex-Mex', 'Southern', 'Restaurants', 'Mexican', 'American (New)']"

They told me that they didn't have any ice so they would use cold water and cold milk. The latt?? was super watery, barely any milk and made my stomach hurt for two days.

What remains excellent is the bread, take away rolls and salads.  I would wish the coffee was better - the Edinburgh competition has left it behind - and the lack of toilet facilities makes it less desirable as a place to sit in.

3,Shanghai Club,"Kind of a funny experience here:  After shopping at the nearby outlet mall, my husband and I decided to look for a Chinese restaurant for lunch.  We found the Shanghai Club at random, but almost didn't go in because from the outside it looks more like a strip club than a proper restaurant.  Imagine our surprise when we opened the mirrored glass front doors just to peak inside, only to find a restaurant filled to more than 50% capacity at lunchtime on a Tuesday. We both ordered from the lunch specials, ranging from $6.50 to $7.50.  I had the Mongolian beef and he had the orange chicken. The cuisine here is standardized Chinese-American food to the max, but both our meals were well prepared, tasty, and of good portion size. The orange chicken was made with all white meat, and fried in relatively fresh oil.  Even my side of banal hot/sour soup was good. My Mongolian beef was slightly overloaded with onions, but included a generous helping of tender stir-fried beef.  I would easily have given this place a 4-star rating had the food been a little more interesting and creative.  The dining room and bathroom were both very clean and orderly, and the place had a nice feel about it.

We tried all three broths.  The ginger chicken was my favorite.   Spicy miso had a kick to it and the kombu was the least flavorful.  They don't have a ton of flavor until you start cooking up your veggies and meats.  

I ordered the Ohio wagyu and found that the broth became very rich and delicious after cooking about 1/4 of my meat.

First off the staff is still great. That factor hasn't changed. The noodles are still very good.  However, it can only go so far.

The amount of meat in their small beef noodle feels much less than before.  I was trying to dig around after eating the noodles to see if there was any meat left because I didn't think I ate that much.  Unfortunately, no avail.

The soup base itself seems to have changed their recipe.  Its either excessively peppered and/or they added MSG to the soup base which is the main factor why the rating today is so low.  My tongue felt really tingly while I was just eating the noodles that I barely drank the soup.

So much so that once I had finished eating I noticed that the soup level barely dropped.  I couldn't bear to drink the soup and I also noticed my companion didn't drink her soup either.

4,Honey Salt,"Finally had a chance to try the trendiest place in town to eat at. I do live on the south side so it was journey traveling all the way here just to grab a bite for lunch. I've passed Rampart Commons numerous times, but never actually shopped at any of the stores. I immediately notice that more than half the cars are luxury cars with range rovers appearing the most, welcome to Summerlin I guess? 

Anyway so Honey Salt is tucked in the corner, a larger sign would probably help them to be more noticeable not that they don't already have good marketing tactics. Apon walking inside from what I remember the walls are mainly composed of bricks. The restaurant is definitely trying to give off that farm vibe, but definitely modern and classy at the same time. A chandelier in a farm though? Haha, I guess that was an accent piece.  I already knew I was going to order the chicken sandwich because of what Misti and Anthony had said in their reviews. Chick Fil A on crack ay? Prior to our food arriving we received our bread and these crispy things almost like pita chips but much thinner. The bread was very similar or even identical to what Filipinos call ""pan de sal,"" but this was a wheat version. Nothing special but the cripy things were rather good and fun to dip with into the white bean dip puree according to my friend? Our food came out pretty quick maybe 15 minutes or so? My friend raved about how good the kale salad was the last time she was here to the point she even dreamt about it. Thankfully the chicken sandwich came with a salad that had kale in it and I was looking forward to it since I've never had kale before. The chicken sandwich was rather stuffed, but that's what I expect when paying $13. The breading on the chicken was pretty good, the honey mustard was probably my favorite part. Usually there isn't enough sauce on sandwiches, but this was the prefect amount. Nice slaw inside the sandwich as well. Overall it was good, but I don't know if it's something to do back flips over if you know what I mean? The side salad was mainly composed of edamame, a little bit of kale, a lot of these seeds (I don't know what kind it was), but which was good. Maybe some type of vinaigrette would have been nice? My friend ordered the meatballs and offered me a bite and that was okay too. Our server Julie was pretty good except I felt like at one point we kind of lost her. The service was definitely better than what I expected based on the early reviews of when they first started. Lastly we ordered the chocolate cake for dessert! OMG soo good probably one of the best pieces of cake I've ever had. 3 layer cake with banana cake in the middle.

I would have told them to cancel it, but the mgr. had me pay for it first after telling me it would be just another minute and as stated, another 25 mins. later it was done.

Later I just felt sick to my stomach and ran into the restroom.

I've never had the Korean dish w squash and cheese and I thought it was an interesting mix of food. The seafood pancake was also very delicious especially if you add the soya sauce it comes with. Also had a taste of their fried chicken, seemed a lil plain to me, must eat with sauce.!

2,Stonegrill,"First, the positives. The continental breakfast buffet is phenomenal. Fresh fruit was exceptional, a wonderful selection of dried fruits and toppings, a cooler with fresh milk (dairy and soy) and a variety of yogurts (light, regular, greek), gluten-free baked goods were a bit stale but I appreciated having those options. Fresh juices such as watermelon mint were a treat. The achiote tofu bowl was exceptional. It was a hearty vegetarian meal with roasted caulifower, braised tofu, quinoa, kale and more. It had great flavor and the portion size was generous.

Now for the negatives. The service was abysmal. I have eaten here with my family 5 times this week already since we are staying at the JW Marriott Desert Ridge. We have come in the morning, afternoon and evening and the service has been poor every.single.time. The hostesses look annoyed and are quite apathetic. In the morning, my children ordered a kids meal that took 40 minutes to receive. It does NOT take 40 mins to make french toast sticks. The server never returned to our table once. I had to get up and roam the restaurant to find him. When I asked about the meals, he brought them and....wait for it...they were cold. It took another 20+ minutes to track him down and get the check. Each time I found him chatting with other employees. We ate on the outside patio at 3pm. It was not busy at that time with only one other family in sight. I asked for a highchair for my baby and it took 20+ minutes to get a highchair. I had to ask 3 separate people to get a highchair. Drinks weren't refilled (on a 110 degree day) and the server had the audacity to add the gratuity on himself.

I have had better service at Denny's and am so disappointed that this restaurant is inside a JW Marriott. It certainly doesn't do the resort any favors. It has a lot of potential, but the staff needs to be overhauled.",2016/8/7,Phoenix,-111.9657063,33.68359197,"['American (Traditional)', 'Restaurants', 'Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Hotel bar', 'Mexican', 'African']"
3,Ceres,"This was my first brunch in a looong time, as I'm not a morning person!
I've been wanting to eat at Ceres for a while and finally decided to make a reservation in person while I was at the property. That was painful as Ceres is open for breakfast then becomes Carmel Room for happy hour and dinner. The employees at the host stand didn't seem interested in taking my reservation but I did get a phone call confirmation after leaving my info.

We were lucky they had jazz brunch on this Sunday and got a table overlooking one of the property's waterfalls.  Here's my issue with this brunch- it's a glorified continental breakfast. I knew this going in so it's a statement more than a complaint. So, most pics posted here represent a former version of brunch when it looked lavish, was more costly and probably included alcohol. I didn't post food pics cause it was too boring. You can also skip the brunch buffet and order from the breakfast menu. 

We had pretty decent omelets, too hard waffles (no toppings! oh the horror), nice fruit selection, very good fresh juice, Greek yogurt, good coffee in too small cups, good pastries. Plenty of Breakfast items but not so much the lunch portion. No salad or soup. No Benedict (a brunch staple for cryin' out loud). The stations were: made to order omelets/waffles; eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausage; fruit, cheese, cold cuts; cereal/pastries. Our server was great and made sure our beverages were filled. They need to jazz up (pun intended) this brunch.

4,Spigolo Ristorante,"The issue with smaller restaurants whose locations do not lend themselves to heavy foot traffic is that it's hard for anyone other than regulars to find out about them. I found it hard to believe that only 3 people have reviewed Spigolo in over 4+ years of existence. That said, upon arriving, I could see how their small sign and the aforementioned hidden location could be something that's affecting them.

This all to say that if you enjoy a treasure hunt, then Spigolo is the treasure chest that awaits you about 40 paces off of Hwy 7 in Woodbridge - it's an absolute delight!

Savour York Region was the draw, as Spigolo had easily one of the best value for money offerings available. $25 for a 3-course prix fixe menu which went far and about anything I've ever seen before. Most restaurants cheap out and cheap out HARD for restaurant weeks, providing meager portion sizes and limited options for appetizer, mains, and desserts. Spigolo rolls out the red carpet offering top shelf choices like Gorgonzola Gnocchi, Veal Steaks, and the absolutely incredible grilled tuna steak - which absolutely floored members of our group last night, and does not skimp on portion size.

They truly get that a restaurant week is the best way to draw customers IN and impress the pants off of them to earn their patronage from then off. My pants are still off as dinner last night blew me away.

To start they offered roasted hot peppers and garlicky black olives with focaccia style pizzas. For my appetizer course, I had a regional Italian specialty that I haven't had in almost 20 years - lumache (or snails). Done in a white wine sauce it was mouth watering, different than I remembered but cooked to a beautiful texture and flavour (I licked my plate when no one was looking).

For my main course, I went with the gorgonzola gnocchi. The sauce was so thick and so creamy it coated my mouth. I asked for a little hot pepper oil and it was stellar and worked so well to cut the creamy cheesy sauce - and burned so good! I'm usually a red sauce gnocchi guy but this was so amazing I couldn't stop myself and ate nearly every last bite.

To conclude, there were 3 dessert options, being in an Italian restaurant it went without saying that I had the Tiramisu option which came served in a stemless martini glass adorned with cookie/chocolate cigar.

Service was excellent as one server managed to deal with our table of 8, and 4 other large tables with grace and poise.

If you're looking for a pleasant dinner surprise in an intimate environment, look no further than Spigolo, you won't be disappointed.

3,Gordon Ramsay BurGR,"So normally I would not be so picky with a review, however I am obsessed with burgers - eating the best anywhere has to offer and also making them at home. It takes a lot to impress me. When I eat a gourmet burger  I have high expectations.

We tried the truffle fries, blue cheese burger and the jalapeno burger we split the burgers in half so we could share( I don't recall the exact names but these were the main toppings). The blue cheese burger was very nice, lots of blue cheese but I though the bun was disappointing. At $15  a burger I expect a much higher quality type of bread. Overall a delicious burger. The Jalapeno one, I was expecting a little spice - not at all spicy, not even an after kick, I didn't even finish it as it was just totally lacking in flavor.

Lastly we ordered the burgers medium well and they came out pink in the middle  and the service was not particularly fast - tons of servers , not that many diners but the kitchen was slow when we went. Everyone was really nice though and they were open late which we appreciated.

The TRUFFLE FRIES - AMAZEBALLS. 

So overall, yes yummy food, but for someone who really considers themselves  a foodie with a burger obsession I felt that while food was good it was overall nothing to really brag about. Go check it out for yourself and order the truffle fries. I personally feel that Umami Burger is much better than this place.",2014/8/13,Las Vegas,-115.172169,36.110724,"['Restaurants', 'Burgers']"

BF and I got our little snack of 2 patties and a pop for $5. Great deal for a good lil snack! I picked the mild beef patty, for pure Nostalgia, and BF got the chicken. The chicken was a bit spicy, kinda curry-like. Both were great, and nice and hot to eat right away.

Side Story: As we eat outside on the bench, we are pestered by little birds for crumbs. My BF bestows some ""age-old"" wisdom to me: birds to do not sh*t on the people who feed them.

4,Buddy V's Ristorante,"This isnt SPECTACULAR Italian food but it is pretty close. We went with two 70 year olds plus a 9 & 11 yr old and everyone liked their meal. This is one of the few restaurants on the strip that actually has real windows to the outside world (no fake ceiling here) which was refreshing. A little loud in the dining room - but then is Vegas known for being quiet? 
We had:
Salumi plate- salumi was terrific, cheeses better than average, olives OK
Eggplant parm- on app menu & can be shared even though waitress said it was too small for sharing. Easily enough for 6 to share
Scallopps- not very Italian, was it bacon? too over cooked but polenta & scallopps were perfect
The lasagne was HUGE & very good.
Kids chix parm was a large sized portion and excellent. 
Chix marsala came with 3 pieces of chicken!
Ceasar Salad was tastey but way over dressed. Very soggy. Ask for less dressing.
With a bottle of wine & tip our meal for 6 was $300. Not an inexpensive night out so don't be misled by the lower $ on yelp.

5,Sushi Mon,"I prefer sashimi over special rolls. A la carte over all you can eat. And eating sushi in non-landlocked states. But I absolutely love Sushi Mon--I love it so much that I forgot about my distinct preferences and had both AYCE lunch ($24) and dinner ($27) here in the same week.

There are dozens of items on the menu, everything made to order, including nigiri, special rolls, side dishes and rice bowls. I assumed the 45-minute limit for lunch and one-hour limit for dinner would be insufficient, but the human body is superhuman under pressure and  service is so fast it redefines fast food. 

The baked green mussels are out of this world. I must have had five on my first visit. I also can't get enough of the special rolls like the spider and volcano. The best part is you can order half rolls, so you can try more rolls. As if the menu selection wasn't enough, there's ice cream to complete your meal.

4,Auberge Willow,"Remember Twin Peaks?  If David Lynch owned a shorefront bar in Quebec this would be the one.

Willow Inn claims to be more than 100 years old, though only the fireplace dates from before the mid-1960s.  Decor is pretty ""rural Canada bar"" style, except for the gorgeous view of the Ottawa river and the Oka ferry going back and forth (back and forth, etc.).  They also have a lawn/terrace where you can have drinks but no food.

Hudson is a charming town about halfway between Ottawa and Montreal.   Even if you've never been there you've seen it before times.  It is often the location for tv shows and movies that purport to be set in small town New England.  

The customers at the Willow are just, well, quirky.  Like a lot of failed reality show performers got together in one place to drink and dine.  (Think of Dog the Bounty Hunter, his lovely wife Beth, any Jersey Shore cast member, and the touring cast of Bon Cop, Bad Cop.)   Downtown Hudson tends to be a lot more buttoned-down.  Out here on the fringes, no so much.

Some of the appeal might be the weekend wine deal? (Liquor store cost plus $5 per bottle).

So enough snobbery.  The food was really good.  The french fries were excellent (and this is perhaps the toughest pommes frites crowd in the world outside of Belgium). I had a carrot cheddar soup that sounds weird but was weird in a delicious way... and the burger was really, really excellent -- thick, juicy and a perfect 10.",2011/5/7,Hudson,-74.1093025,45.4484916,"['Bed & Breakfast', 'Hotels', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Venues & Event Spaces', 'Restaurants', 'Hotels & Travel']"

5,Canoe,"Updating my past review for Canoe - I still give it 5 stars!
Service was excellent. Our waiter was very friendly and courteous.

Drinks:
White wine pairing (Forgot the name.. haha)

Appetizers:
S'MORES FOIE GRAS
(graham cracker crumble, chocolate sauce and toasted marshmallow cream)
So far I still think Canoe makes one of the best foie gras dishes in Toronto. I've tried other ways of making the foie gras dishes at Canoe before and it never disappoints! Always very delicious.

Mains:
WAGYU TRI-TIP
(smoked tongue, king oyster mushrooms, purple potato + bacon chive jus)
Highly recommending this! So glad they didn't take this off the menu - out of all the dishes I've tried so far, the wagyu beef is the most tender and delicious one :)

ONTARIO LAMB DUO 
(roasted loin + olive anchovy rubbed lamb ham, rosemary artichokes, fresh shelled beans)
Such a cute display. The lamb was very tender (each meat was a different part of the lamb).
The veggies paired with it were also delish!

GRASS RUBBED BISON RIB EYE
(green tomato, horseradish greens, pickled cauliflower, tonka bean + k2 Milling grain pakoras)
The meats were amazing - but I didn't really like the pickled cauliflower. A little too sour for my taste. Other than that, everything about this dish was wonderful.

Dessert:
CLASSIC CANOE BUTTER TART
(smoked vanilla cream, flax seed nougatine, rye + ginger ice cream)
We were actually trying to order the dessert that we got last time but chose the wrong one haha. BUT! It was a good ""mistake"" because this was DELICIOUS!! So yummy!! 
I loved it - especially the ginger ice cream!! It was a lovely combo with the flax seed nougatine (if only they had more of this! :D)",2015/7/5,Toronto,-79.382159,43.646954,"['American (New)', 'Restaurants', 'Canadian (New)']"
5,The White Chocolate Grill,Excellent food and service!!!  We make a point to visit this restaurant at least once a week.  I always order the Famous chicken salad or the French dip but my husband orders many different things on the menu and they are all wonderful.  Dessert is a must!!!  The White chocolate bread pudding is the best bread pudding I have ever had!  The white chocolate brownie is very rich and tasty.  The cheesecake is by far the best cheesecake in the valley.  The only thing I can complain about is they use to serve a coconut cream pie as a special desert and we have not been able to get this is a very long time.,2011/8/28,Phoenix,-111.92641,33.655566,"['Restaurants', 'American (Traditional)']"
5,Kelly's At Southbridge,"Found a HIDDEN GEM in the heart of Downtown Scottsdale / Camelback Area!
Right on the corner of 6th & Stetson Dr. is a delightful, welcoming 'CHEERS' type bar & restaurant! 
Friendly place on a Saturday night !
(6pm) Greeted & seated right away in a BIG comfy booth with a big window overlooking their nice outdoor patio area. 
The attentive waiter came right away & told us about the specials.
We decided on their AWARD-winning Burger and Chicken sandwich, however. 
They were both DELICIOUS & prepared/ seasoned just right. Mine came with saut??ed vegetables & burger came with tasty seasoned fries.
Great service, GREAT food in a warm, friendly atmosphere will keep us coming back!

5,E-Jo Korean Restaurant,"I came here with my parents, since Baja Fresh was closed. They asked me how about this place... I was hesitate at first, since I didn't hear much great things, but when my mother told me all my relatives from Korea LOVED this place when they visited Vegas for my cousin's wedding... that changed everything. My mother goes.. have you even tried their food??!! I said Nooo, but heard it wasn't good. Then she goes.. how You know that if you never tried this place yet??!?!! Good point...

That being said... we went in and the owner recognized my Father. My father goes.. you remember me?? The owner goes... yes of course!!! The story behind this was.. when my relatives from Korea were in town.. they literally came here every single day for two weeks. They Loved their soups and thought it was better than Tofu Hut. The owner even gave my uncle a free bottle of soju when he ate there.. If you don't know about my uncle.. he drinks soju... in the morning, afternoon, evening, and even late night!! It's a Korean tradition back home I swear!!!

We all ordered their Oxknee Soup.. which is #5 on the top list of food picture you see on the right side when you walk in or in the menu book .. under Soup.. it's #3 called Beef Knee Bone Soup. If you like tendons, the chewy muscles... this will be your favorite soup to have. My parents say this soup is the best from all the others. The broth is milky, beige from all the slow cooking from the bones of the meats. It's so soothing and tasty. I loved it!!! I added tons of sliced green onion and a tablespoon of salt, but you can determine how much you want. The tendons were soft, jelly-like chewy texture... only a few were somewhat firm in chewing. If the pieces are too big to put in your mouth, there's a scissor to cut it in pieces.. which is also used for the two types of kimchi they give you. One is napa cabbage and the other is daikon radish... it comes in two thick dark jars and an endless amount of kimchi to your hearts desire!!! There's a separate dish, where you place the kimchi's to cut into pieces and add to the soup or eat as a condiment. They first bring out six complimentary pieces of deep fried zucchini.. then the kimchi. We were also given a jalapeno, daikon, and diced onion marinated in soy sauce to eat on the side with the soup.

The daikon radish kimchi was perfectly fermented that it had a great crunch and crisp, fresh taste to it. My mother commented on how good it was. They also give you a sauce to dip the tendons in, which consist of soy sauce and hot mustard.. you mix it together and dip the tendon or should I say coat the tendon in and eat it with the bowl of rice... sip the broth of the soup after and it all goes down so well. Delicious, soothing, and perfect for a cold winter night or day!

They provide barley tea and at the end.. you get a free cup of cold, refreshing sweet rice drink for dessert. It also helps with digestion my mother pointed out. Great way to wash everything down and even in Winter, it was so invigorating to drink. Loveloveloved it!!! 

This place is right across the street, adjacent to Cafe Moda and in the same complex of 168 Market. It has brown brick walls and a red sign on top of the restaurant. The sign is written in Korean, so don't bother looking for E-Jo at all. They have about eight tables inside and a tv that has some korean drama playing. I didn't think much of this place from the reviews I read, but this place ended up to be such a delightful surprise. They are known for their soups and tasty broth. Service was great and the soup was therapeutic. It stayed hot for a long while, since the pot kept the heat in the soup and even after.. the broth stayed perfectly warm to just sip through. My father told me when you eat this soup, you won't get hungry for a long time. It was very filling, but in a good way. It just relaxes you... I guess you really can't judge a place by a few bad reviews. You need to come here and try it yourself or at least with someone that knows what's good here.

4,Famous Dave's BBQ,"We come here with my in-laws when they are in town. They love BBQ, and we know what to expect from Famous Daves. 

We always start with the Onion Strings. They are crispy, slightly greasy and really flavorful. They come with a r??moulade sauce. Once you start eating these, it's difficult to stop. 

We each got the 2 meat lunch special. I got the BBQ chicken, and the ribs. It was 1/4 chicken with a dry rub, and two ribs. I was served the white meat chicken, while my mother-in-law was given dark meat. There was quite a bit of meat on both the chicken and the ribs. We each got a corn muffin along with the meat, and a choice of a side. I got the potato salad, which had a bit of what I am guessing was pickle relish. I am not a fan of relish, but it was just a touch and was pretty tasty. 

My MIL asked for extra butter, and was given a small cup of whipped butter. What comes with the muffins are small plastic containers of butter, so this was a nice touch. I like that there is roll of paper towels at the table...no need to ask for extra napkins...and many different BBQ sauces to choose from. If you have never been to Famous Dave's, they will describe each of the sauces for you.

The food was great but at times awkward to eat (spoonfuls of ceviche and fall-apart fish tacos).

Michael the bartender is very good as well as the other female bartender forget her name 
Food and service excellent !
Disappointed that they no longer have daily specials they were a nice add to the regular
menu 
Happy that they always now have the steak and fries 
Will gladly go back",2017/1/19,Charlotte,-80.8314309,35.1561919,"['American (New)', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Restaurants']"
5,Wild Wing,"Had the Monday night boneless wings special with fries and poutine and a couple of beers. It was quiet but the service (Stephanie) was exceptional! The wings hit the spot - had the honey garlic and the ""hottest sauce"", both were very good. Fries were cooked to a medium well (slightly golden brown and not soggy). Very clean dining area with tons of TVs for everyone's viewing pleasure. Very tempted to come back for the Tuesday half price wings special (with a purchase of a drink).",2017/1/10,Mississauga,-79.697446,43.608348,"['Chicken Wings', 'Restaurants']"
2,Taqueria Guadalajara,"In the famous words of Chuck D and Flavor Flave ""don't believe the hype.""

For years our friends of been raving about this place.  We have heard people call this the ""best Mexican restaurant in Madison"" and other people call it the ""absolute best Mexican food period.""   So after a couple years of wanting to try this place...we finally did.

I cannot complain about the aesthetics...it is a cute little place without all the traditional bright colors....but thats where the good ends.

FIRST OFF:   How can you have a Mexican Restaurant that does not serve Margaritas?    Really?   When I want to devour a burritos I want some Tequila and Lime to go with it.   Even if it is the pre-made junk.

SECOND:  The food was bland.....about as bland as bland can be.   My wife ordered a Chicken Quesadilla as she always does at Mexican restaurant and it literally had ZERO taste.    Heck she had to use all of the salsa form the chips to even remotely get a flavor to it.   Oh...and speaking of chips....they are complete straight out of the bag store bought terrible chips.  Even Laredo's has better chips....well...actually they have better food all together and that is saying a lot!

THRID:  Lets talk my burrito.   I decided to go a different route than my normal fajitas or taco salad and got myself a steak burrito.   OMG....this this was.....TERRIBLE!   The steak was as hard as a rock.  The burrito itself was even more bland than my wife's quesadilla and literally had NO TASTE AT ALL.   Worst part is she stole all the salsa and it took the rest of the meal to get more.

So...when heading up Park street and wanting Mexican food this place is a joke.   Traditional....sure but tasteless traditional and just...I would rather eat at Taco Bell.",2015/9/2,Madison,-89.3974165,43.055569,"['Mexican', 'Restaurants']"
5,Rosati's,Best chicago pizza in town. So far everything has been outstanding. Prices are reasonable and they send out coupons in the local value-pack. Highly recommended for anything you want on this menu.,2014/6/9,Las Vegas,-115.2790394,36.306775,"['Restaurants', 'Pizza']"

1,Oregano's Pizza Bistro,"This location was my worst Oregano's experience ever. I have been to several other valley locations over the years and have never been disappointed by the food or level of service provided. Being that this location is the newest, and also the consistency between other locations, I had high expectations for my experience here. 
First of all, the waitress that served our table did not seem well suited for her position. She seemed lost and overwhelmed the entire dinner, did not check in frequently enough to fill our drinks, and generally did not seem to understand the responsibilities of a waitress. 
As for the food, I was extremely disappointed. I love the pesto pizza and the Italian wedding soup and both were a major let down here. The pizza had hardly any pesto, which completely lacked flavor, and was smothered in way too much cheese. The soup was also greatly lacking in flavor as well as the meatballs. Overall, the food was tasteless and inconsistent with other oregano's locations. On top of this we had to wait over an hour to get our food with no explanation as we sat and waited. 
I will not be returning to this location nor will I recommend it to anyone.",2015/7/10,Goodyear,-112.3878982,33.46496233,"['Pizza', 'Restaurants', 'Italian', 'Sandwiches']"

1,China Poblano,"Walking up to this restaurant, I thought it was a Mexican and Chinese infused ingredients/food/flavor restaurant which would have been original and creative. In actuality, you can order dim sum and a taco at the same time here. 

The Mexican food was flavorful. The guac was perfect balance of cilantro and onion and avocado. The homemade salsa had some kick and their Mexican meat was tender. 

On the other hand, the sui mai I ordered was a big disappointment. It was almost to the point of raw and tiny compared to typical dim sum restaurants. I didn't like the fact that I just had guac and then took a bit of dim sum after. 

The biggest reason I'm giving this place 1 star and never coming back is the seating arrangement. The tables are about a foot away from each other and when I went, the place was near empty and the hostess still sat a group of men at the table right beside us. We were so close to them that the guy beside me flicked me with his menu turning it over on accident twice. There were empty tables behind me and behind my friend. The only excuse we got was that they like to close half the restaurant.",2014/5/7,Las Vegas,-115.1748137,36.10987091,"['Asian Fusion', 'Mexican', 'Restaurants', 'Chinese']"
4,The Buffet,"Saturday lunch: $32

Surprisingly it wasn't packed at all! If you were @ the Bellagio, there's a line almost all the time. We chose to go around 3 just before dinner starts because it's $7 cheaper. It's $39 for dinner btw.Their selections are pretty much the same like the Bellagio (Italian, Pizza, Salads, Shellfish, Desserts, Crepes, Prime Rib, etc etc). Unfortunately, I didn't get to try everything! There was so much to try and we got full after an hr.

We started off with salads and I love it. I don't know what kind of dressing they use but it was good. Yes, I paid $32 for some delicious salads!! Got a full plate of king crab legs because that's pretty much all you go to the buffet for? The line is always long for this so make sure to grab something on your plate and eat while waiting. I think it tastes better hot than cold so just ask them to grill it up for you. I didn't try their salmon & chicken but I heard it's not bad! 

Since I tried Wynn Buffet from many years ago, I really didn't pay attention about the sushi at that time. Unfortunately, they only have 3 rolls for the sushi selection. Booo-hoo! This is why I preferred the Bellagio better because they do have sushi even though their rice sucks! I just eat it without the rice = sashimi! 

Their desserts selection is soo cute! Everything is tiny so you get to try a lot of stuffs. I don't remember if Bellagio is the same or not. I tried a whole bunch and one of them was my favorite. Too bad I didn't check the name for it. It is in a little long cup!",2010/11/25,Las Vegas,-115.16559,36.12688722,"['Buffets', 'Restaurants']"
4,The Mad Greek Cafe,"Day 033/365
Yelp Challege 2011

My last night in Las Vegas.  Tia and Jesse gave me a gift certificate to the Mad Greek Cafe.  Jesse told me that he couldn't really eat anything at this restaurant and he received the gift certificate as a thank you gift for placing an ad for his garage door installation business.

I'd never been to such a HUGE Greek restaurant ever!  There were white Greek lawn ornaments on the roof of their restaurant, a dance floor inside, and a huge chandelier hanging from the ceiling.

I ordered the stuffed grape leaves (my favorite) and their small Greek salad.  The grape leaves didn't come with any dipping sauce, but they were still good.

There was a crazy hamburger on the menu that consisted of a heaping of pastrami on top of the burger patty!  I don't usually order burgers at restaurants, so I just read about it.",2011/9/6,Las Vegas,-115.278464,36.1428,"['Greek', 'Mediterranean', 'Restaurants']"

1,Wicked Spoon,"How Wicked Spoon got anything over 2 stars is beyond me. First off, my favorite Vegas buffet at the moment is at the Aria. But since my cousin told me that Wicked Spoon was 10x's better, my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try. We went there dinner time on a Tuesday night, and the place was half filled. We are seated immediately and head over to the food to begin Gorge Fest 2011. I was excited at first because of the presentation. A lot of the food came in cute little pots, but most of it was lacking in taste. I tried the bone marrow, which is supposed to be their specialty, I have to say there was more grease than marrow. The shrimp was alright, plump but that's all I can say about it. The crab legs were ok, but I was a bit disappointed since the Aria offers not just snow crab legs, but also King crab. Again, the Wicked Spoon was only visually pleasing, because the dessert bar kinda made me feel like a kid in a candy store with all their selections. I must have had 8 different desserts on my plate, and none are really worth mentioning.

4,CHUBZ Famous Chiliburgers,"Visited for the first time early evening on a Saturday. It was about half full with customers. I ordered the combo that included a double chilicheese burger, fries and drink. Burgers are cooked to order and the food was delivered to my table in a reasonable time. My impressions:
- Burger was very good but somewhat sloppy, as expected. Chili was good but not exceptional. Homemade cole slaw is available if you want a Carolina-style chiliburger
- Fries were excellent, just as good as Five Guys and almost as many on the plate
- Decent selection of soft drinks and fresh brewed iced tea
- The table next to me had ordered the onion rings and they commented that they were the best they had ever had.

Suggestions:
- Don't place trash cans next to dining tables
- A roll of rough paper towels on each table is not an improvement over decent napkins

Conclusion: Yes, I would definitely eat here again and also try the onion rings.",2014/7/24,Charlotte,-80.88416526,35.17999215,"['Restaurants', 'Burgers']"
2,Angelina's Pizzeria,Ordered a medium pizza and 12 piece wings last night. Wait time was normal not too bad. I was really disappointed in the quality of the pizza. It looked and tasted like it hadn't been cooked long enough the dough was slightly raw and every time I picked up a slice all of the toppings fell off which forced me to eat it with a fork for the most part. I wouldn't mind a longer wait time if they would have just cooked the damn pizza properly. The wings on the other hand were pretty good. It was definitely overpriced for what I got. Im mostly giving this place two stars  because they didn't cook the pizza long enough.,2016/1/22,Las Vegas,-115.2074087,36.0853026,"['Pizza', 'Burgers', 'Restaurants', 'Salad']"

My best friend and I recently popped in here on a beautiful day in Stockbridge. We were very hungry, and the sight of Croque Monsieur from our half torn menu looked extremely entising. 

But.. when it arrived. What I saw, was not so Parisian, we got 1 whole see-through slice of ham. woopdidoo. 

The cheese wasn't very awesome either, especially when you can see I.J Mellis next door. They should start getting a bit of their cheese from there! I felt like I was eating a new style of cheese wiz. That thing had weird texture. 

Also, lets not get on the salad, it was a little bit disappointing with a few bits of iceburg lettuce.

Ordered pretzel balls that come with provolone cheese fondue.  Wow, wow, that made it worth the trip besides our entrees.

but after our food came out, a large crowd of young men sat at the table next to us, ordered 2 hookah's and yech.....we let the food stay on the table. the sweet smokey smell of hookah obliterated any hunger we had.

Barista was very friendly and made me a nice cortado. The taste of the coffee was above average, a tad more bitter than I usually like it, but the readily available raw sugar on the bar made a vast improvement. I'd say it's on par with Lux and a cut above Cartel.

Last week, the entire line of people gave up after waiting for 15 minutes and went to Subway for lunch. The only person to get eye contact from an employee also got tools they couldn't get what they ordered. Something about a special code needed to make the grills hot?

The chicken had a really nice crispy breading and there was plenty of chicken on the club. The sauce on the club was yummy too. The Szechuan Shrimp Po-Boy flavor caught me off guard at first because it was very unique, but I ended up enjoying the sandwich. The shrimp on this also had a nice, light breading.

Service was wonderful - I ordered a mocha (delicious!!) and my friend had a cappuccino. As well, my friend had the prosciutto pizza and I got the margherita blanche. They arrived on cute wooden boards, as well as an infused oil of some sort that I found myself dipping my crust into. The pizza was flavorful and delicious (it also made for yummy leftovers the next morning haha!). The decor was magical, almost like walking into a treehouse turned cafe, with its wooden structure and foliage hanging from the ceiling. There was also an outdoor terrace. It definitely did not seem like we were in the hustle-and-bustle of downtown.

4,Hawker Bar,"Hawker Bar pays homage to Singapore style street 'hawker' food with it's own rustic and Western twist to it.  A team of super friends including the owners of one of my very favourite establishments, Poutini's, are behind this intimate resto located on the trendy Ossington strip and have opened my eyes and taste buds to the versatile sweet, sour and spicy flavours of Singapore cuisine.The appetizers we sampled are must haves at Hawker.The Chilli Salt tofu were little deep fried tofu cubes that were lightly dusted with chilli salt and refreshing lime were a good bite size in your mouth with a nice pop of flavour and crunch.  
Additionally the Singapore chicken wings are good enough for just a savoury snack or to wet your pallet for your meal.   They were salty but sweet and a hint of spice, wet enough but dry and not too too messy - my kind of wings.  We fought over the last one in our group of four. 

For mains, we sample a number of dishes on the menus which were made out of cardboard - a nice touch to the modesty of street culture. 
The first dish that came out was their version of the Hainanese Chicken rice.  I grew up on poached chicken so I was in love.  The only complaint is I adore dark meat and it was only served with white meat.  The chicken was served with 3 different sauces (chilli, soy and ginger) and the trick to this dish is to experiment and mix the sauces with the chicken to create different combinations of flavour.  My recommendation is to pair the chicken with ginger and a hint of the chilli!
We also sampled the 'singapore style' noodles - the flavours were unlike any Asian noodle dish that I have had, it was complex and heavy but light all the while being a delicious addition to our meal.  
We had to try Hawker's version of the popular Singapore dish - the Laksa Lemak which is a thick and rich coconut curry soup with yellow rice noodles, fresh snow peas, egg plant, red pepper and tofu puffs all mixed into it.  Our portion size was definitely large enough to share with the four of us and then some.  It was creamy and tart with good texture from the fresh ingredients and a surprise runny egg which was a nice bonus.

Finally we tried their sting ray.  I have never been a huge fan of sting ray but the server convinced me that it would taste as rich and tender as scallops and right he was!  It was really flaky and light however there was too much sting and not enough ray referring to the number of long bones in the sting ray so be very careful when eating.

Our bellies were quite full of Hawker style food but also cocktails as we drank our way through their creative drink menu as well but we were convinced again by our server to attempt dessert which were their banana fritters.  Came to our table bright green, served with red bean ice cream, were simply delectable and a perfect way to end our evening.

What a good introduction to the flavours of Singapore!   This is a great spot for a new type of Asian cuisine and would highly recommend a visit!",2012/11/9,Toronto,-79.4203829,43.6482809,"['Asian Fusion', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Bars']"

The lounge room food was very limited. It had the least food variety compared to all other Intercontinental I stayed before.  The staff in the lounge room was very friendly though.

But when it came down to sitting down, there was no booth. I asked and they said none were available...even when I pointed to one across from me. The hostess said they need them to seat more people. Ten minutes later, a couple is seated there. I don't know if you can understand my frustration but that made me livid. Our waitress hardly checked on us. Water was always empty.

It is what I like to call American Mexican food. 

If your looking for authentic, this is not the place. If your looking for a large portion of beans and rice with still tasty food, this is where I would come. I'm not saying this is horrible food, I'm just saying that when I'm craving Mexican, I'm for sure not coming here.

The wait staff was quick on their feet, and the Margarita I got was full of booze. So no complaints in that department. Nice outdoor seating! Great Bar area!

I still giving this place only 2 stars because I have had good Mexican food, and this is just not it. 

If I had to rate it for decent food not as a genre.....3 stars, but there are so many other things I could eat for the same amount at better food joints.

The problem was that they had flies in the restaurant. It was annoying having to keep swatting the flies away when we were inside and not outside.

It took me a while to get up to try this quaint little gem out, but it was well worth the wait. I went up on Sunday afternoon (12/1/08) for brunch with my friend Jamie. Both of us we pleasantly surprised on the nice little location on the corner and little picnic style table outside. 

First we walked around and looked at all the specialty items that were scattered around the store. Being a wine enthusiast, I got to see some interesting wines sitting in their beautiful wine racks. 

For how busy it was in there, it only took us 2 minutes to order, because of their employees to help guide you though. Both of us ordered delicious egg sandwiches on english muffins. Having choices of different topping I went with avocado, sausage, tomato, and cheese. With Jamie doing the similar, but with bacon. (There was a jealously generous amount of it too!) 

While we waited for the sandwiches, we got coffees from their espresso bar, and walked around the shop some more. After grabbing the sandwiches and taking them outside to share a picnic table with some strangers, we devoured our orders and sipped out coffees.

Once you eat here, you're spoiled and no other place can measure up!

I've been eating here at least 1-2 times a month for about 6 years now. It's just fantastic, and the food and service make up for the Styrofoam plates and plastic cutlery. Every time I have a guest in from out of town, THIS is where I take them. My boyfriend always jokes that it's the only place he's ever eaten where he can't help but make yummy-noises with every single bite. I used to live right around the corner, but even though I'm in north Toronto now, we still make the drive frequently to get our Lahore Tikka fix!

Every time we come we get the butter chicken, palak paneer, channa masala, aloo ghobi, and several rice and naan, with sweet lassi. In the summer, I'll get a kulfi which they make in-house and which is just fantastic, and in the winters I'll sometimes indulge in their Kashmir tea that they make at your table for you. I've never once been disappointed in all the times I've been there.

It has a nice community feel, with the big open-concept dining room. I LOVE in summer time when they open up a huge covered patio for diners. Although the staff there is huge - which is great, because you always get great attendant service - they make you feel at home. Several of the servers there always recognize me, and give me a big welcome, asking how I've been, cracking jokes about how recently I've been in, or noticing if something kept me away for awhile. 

Everything is made fresh, and it comes out sizzling. The flavors are deep, and complex, with just the right amount of spice - makes your nose run, but doesn't flay your tongue and palette!

Finally after about 10 mins the other couple and there kids got there food remind you they had ordered pancakes, i mean anyone knows pancake do NOT take that long to make. After we got our food and another refill we were asked about ice cream, we never asked for it but I guess it's included in every meal which would of been great if my daughter would have been with us.

Lets start off with the ambiance 6/5...this is one of the nicest restaurants I have ever been to anywhere.  Minimalist decor, super, super spacious, many options including semi private couch seating for couples - all with incredible views of Scottsdale and sorrounding mountains....

Caesar salad 2/5 (it was the only food on the menu I did not care for as it had bacon and other non-traditional ingredients I did not like)

12 oz Filet 5/5 (medium rare plus)

Side order of mushrooms and cauliflour 5/5

Bread 4/5

Chocolate Dessert 5/5, special root beer dessert weak 2/5

Service 5/5

Pricing is fair and comparable to most upscale steak houses. 

Bottom line...if you want the best steakhouse in Phoenix, maybe the camelback inn's BLT steak is still the best for steak (bone-in filet), an Ocean Club at Kierland (if you want more of a people watching, live music & open restaurant feel) But dont discard orange sky if you are looking for incredible views, in a super chic setting, with pretty good food and service.",2014/6/10,Scottsdale,-111.8694415,33.54028594,"['Steakhouses', 'Seafood', 'Restaurants', 'American (New)']"
3,Rachel's Kitchen,"Ive heard such great things, so I expected great things. It was good, but not great.

To start, I understand that while people are preparing others foods, when you see two people standing there waiting to order, the least you can say is, I'll be with you shortly, or someone will be with you shortly, or hey, go screw yourself.....something! That kinda put me off, but whatever, I'm hungry, let's eat!

I ordered the grilled veggie salad. I was disappointed it didn't come with more veggies. The ones that were there were delicious! The roasted red peppers were not. I loathe jarred roasted peppers. Take the time and toast them yourself, it's easy and not very time consuming. I will say it was a nice sized bowl of lettuce, I liked that. The dressing was OK, definitely could have used some more, but I wasn't about to go stand there like an idiot again and wait for it.

My friends ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and a wrap. They wrap the wrap in lots and lots of paper. It took her some time to get it off (pervert, I know that you are thinking!). They also ordered 2 smoothies before the meal. One was a peanut butter one and it was tasty but too thick, especially for the straw they provide. The other was a banana kinda smoothie that while I dont dig the banana taste, it was much easier to enjoy.

My company, the absolutely FABULOUS Christina and Arvin, made the meal fantastic. I always have the best time with them and enjoy every minute!

When he was done, we wanted to get everything on the menu because they all sound amazing! Then, he was kind enough to offer us samples of his two daily soups while we were deciding what to get. And then, of course, we wanted to get the Shrimp Bisque too (simply heavenly)!

Since we went for tea, we ended up only getting a chocolate torte, lemon torte, croissant, thai chai, hot chocolate and white mocha. Please, please do get the tortes.

  They offer so many delightful omelets, pancakes and crepes, I'm looking forward to my next visit. Maybe I'll have the banana custard pancakes with nutella spread and sliced bananas. Or maybe I will have the salmon benedict; eggs benedict with smoked salmon and light caper sauce. MMM mm mm.

We had a very bad customer service experience. Their website has coupons you can print and take with you. We were standing near the counter and trying to decide to use the 2 hours for the price of one or the bogo discounts. The guy at the counter said we could start bowling and they would us the coupon that was less expensive when we were done.

We kept our eyes on the lock and after a while decided we'd use the two hours for the price of one option. The problem is that when we went to pay there was a different guy at the counter. He told us the hourly option was pre-pay only. He made no effort to help us out and was really quite disagreable.

This is unfortunate. We live within walking distance but have always gone to Villiage Lanes in Monona.

Of course we were offered an opportunity for a beverage however there was no follow up for a refill the entire time we were waiting for our food. Also after the food finally arrived there was no follow up to see if everything came out as ordered. I could go into more detail but as you can tell the speed and customer attention were quite lacking.

Now on to the food. I don't give two stars just based on a one time service problem however if a restaurant has such an issue coupled with bland food then there is not much to raise my rating.

3,Thor Espresso Bar,"Ambiance/Good-Stuff

As the name suggests, this place definitely is a tribute to the Swedish style of home decor and it's quite minimalistic in style. Many reviews describe it as cozy, I describe it as lacking but I suppose that's the whole point. Being 6""3, i found it really hard to sit in many of their chairs while their bar stools were uncomfortably positioned made this an awkward chill-out time for me. Fast and reliable internet, the lack of workspace makes it a hard sell if you want to do any work..

While the rude barista attitude can be forgiven(only one of them), the espresso-based beverages make up for it completely. My first impression of the Mjolnir shot is that it's a fantastic choice if you want something to give you a good kick (hint: mix the condensed milk and espresso quite thoroughly). I finished the experience with a simple cappuccino which actually might be one of the best and tastiest caps i've ever had the pleasure of drinking :)

Barista skills: 10 - A new favorite espresso shot + plus general great tasting coffee
Barista Attitude: 5 - One was a total douche while the other was super nice about the whole experience
Dating Appeal: 5 - Not my place to take someone out to have a long earth-shattering chat but it might be yours?
Overall Ambiance: 6 - If i'm in Toronto and I want an ""out of this world"" espresso experience in my mouth then this is it (and yes, worth the amazing walk on King Street West :)).

I think the place was only opened a few days, I would also rate it higher if they had it staffed properly. Arrived at lunch, and the staff is in ""training"" mode so it took forever for them to take the two orders ahead of me, and the line behind grew very quickly.  If the service was quick, then I would certainly rate it a four.  Had the ""Bueno Burger"" with jack cheese.  I think this is something else I don't like about the place, you need to add .75 for cheese. I'd prefer if they included cheese with each type of burger. The burger was certainly good, not sure if its as good as Smash Burger, but certainly in the same league (not a comparison to Delux).

Two things anyone eating here should still be aware of:  First, the portions are too large, which is certainly not going to bother most people - but if you're coming with a group, or with kids, just keep it in mind.

This was one of the best roast beef sandwiches I have ever had, much better than Arby's by far. The fries were also very good. 
There is a large private parking lot on the south side of the building. Easy access off 16th St, better to approach from the south, there are two parking lot entrances on 16th St. Check out their menu and  hours online before you go. www.joesdineraz.com

The place has always appeared clean, staff was fast and friendly, sort of like ""you are family"" friendly.

I met a friend at Perk for a weekday lunch last Wednesday.  I'd been wanting to try it for awhile and wasn't surprised to find it hiding in a strip mall (like so many little gems here in AZ).  The atmosphere was nothing special but we chose to sit outside as it was a beautiful day.  My friend had an omelette and I had a Greek Salad.  The service was not attentive despite the fact that there were few patrons while we were there.  (I have a feeling they get slammed for weekend brunches though).  The food was good; not mindblowing, but decent.  I like the fact that they use fresh, local, and organic ingredients.  One more perk is that I believe they have free wi-fi (but I cannot attest to using it).

When we did get the attention of our server, he seemed irritated he had to wait on us. 

I understand at happy hour they get busy but message to the management, hire more servers. People are desperately looking for jobs and what do you pay them, like $2.30 an hour? 

The good news was the food was fresh and arrived quickly (they had expediters). I am happy to report the kitchen staff seems to have their act together.",2011/1/2,Chandler,-111.8977551,33.3056575,"['American (New)', 'Restaurants', 'Sushi Bars']"
4,Orale! Kitchen,"I've been here a couple of times with friends. I would describe this place as hipster Mexican. Food wise- I've tried the spicy guacamole, tortilla soup, chile relleno, and chicken tacos. All were delicious. I think my favorite part of the meal was trying all the various types of salsas they have. The waitress we had brought over a bowl of each of the types and kept them coming during the entire meal! They were all delicious and so different. The food tasted fresh and the atmosphere was very casual. The restaurant is small, which in my opinion, makes the experience that much more cozy.

3,Panera Bread,"I'll leave my review at 3 stars for now.  This was my first visit to a Panera Bread to get sandwiches for dinner.  We needed a break from getting subs at different places and I chose to try something new.  This location opened recently.  It makes where I live about halfway between to Panera's but I decided to try this one.

Service was great at the counter, but the wait seemed long for the take out until I realized they had a number of people eating in who had ordered just before I got there.  I brought the sandwiches home and they were very good.  My wife had their Cuban chicken panini and I had the signature Steak and white cheddar.  They were both very good.  My panini had a fair kick from the horseradish spread on the sandwich.  With the sandwiches, I opted for the small bag of chips for each of us.

The order was packaged really nice in two small cardboard boxes.  My only complaint with this is there's really no way to tell which sandwich is which unless you peel back some of the bread to reveal the contents.  Some places put a numbered sticker on their sandwiches to match the items on your receipt.  The boxes at Panera have a place you could write the name.  I sent a suggestion to HQ and the responded that they'd look into it.

I'll return and I think I'll eat in.  The dining room is very nice and there's outdoor seating for when it's cooler.",2013/6/28,Las Vegas,-115.2891617,36.16327885,"['Salad', 'Breakfast & Brunch', 'Bagels', 'Food', 'Soup', 'Restaurants', 'American (New)', 'Sandwiches']"

We arrived and sat down and were quickly surprised to find that they were not offering brunch, only lunch.  The sign in the elevator said brunch was offered from 11 to 3:30 but that was apparently just for the restaurant downstairs.  I'm honestly not sure if that's true.  We decided to eat anyway because we were starving.

We got some drinks and ordered an appetizer.  The appetizer was excellent, but that was the only positive point of the meal other than the weather and the view.  I ordered a veggie burger and it tasted / looked like a cheap patty that came out of a frozen package.  

After we ate we then proceeded to wait for what must have been at least a half hour before our bills came.  The place was filling up and our waiter looked busy but unfortunately we were tucked away in a corner that was essentially forgotten about.  The waiter was apologetic when he finally did return which was appreciated.

4,Zakkushi,"I was overwhelmed with the menu when I first visited. There are many items that you can't easily figure out how they taste, and not a lot of them sound very filling. It's probably one of the most expensive restaurants I could go to because most items on the menu are ordered PER skewer. Each skewer is a little bigger than the size of your index finger and cost $2~8.
They serve really really great food, no question about that. However I just can't get over how expensive the bill can get. As some have suggested, pre-eat before you come here.
The atmosphere is very authentic and the servers were nice and responsive. I would come back (with a full stomach) for hanging out with friends for a beer and a set of 5 skewers that they have on the menu.",2015/11/25,Toronto,-79.3706875,43.6635147,"['Restaurants', 'Japanese']"

They are best known for their Butter Burgers and their Custard.  Me, personally, I will go there just for the custard.  I recommend a small or medium chocolate custard concrete mixer with brownie pieces.  Yummy!!!  Don't get a large, because that is way too much, you'll get a tummy ache.  If ever I'm feeling down, I will always turn to Culver's.  Their butter burgers are good as well.  Low fat and low in calories....Yeah right.  But they sure are tasty.  

My friend is from Wisconsin and will go here just for the cheese curds.  

Culver's is a place to go once in awhile as a treat to yourself, because the prices are little on the high side.

Can you really blame me? When the food is as good as this, it's almost a sin not to be. 

Let me explain, I had a hot veal sandwich and it was really good. With that, I had a Brio to wash it down. The bread was tasty, the veal was cooked perfectly (as expected), and the heat from the hot peppers was alright. I would have preferred it to have been a little hotter, but I'm not complaining.

After I had the veal sandwich I had a grill chicken sandwich (ok, I only ate half of it) and it was good. 

This begs the question, can they do no wrong? I'l have to go back, try something else and I'll let you know.

4,Chicken Shack,"I don't entirely know why, but I'm kind of obsessed with Chicken Shack. I'm rarely on that side of town, but have noticed it on my way to Ross J's. It looked kinda ghetto so I stayed away till a couple weeks ago when Ross J's was closed early. I'm glad I tried it because I'm a little addicted now.

I'm probably kind of biased because their plain wings taste just like when my mom makes korean chicken before she dips it in the sauce. Nostalgia is a funny thing, but I do think they're also just really good wings. 

Price is about $1/wing and many have mentioned that's overpriced, but that seems standard to me for restaurants - BWW is about the same. Chicken Shack also has huge drummies and wings, not broken or midget ones like a lot of other places. I'm a fatty, but I was full off of 6 wings because they're bigger and meatier. 

For sides, we've tried the cole slaw, baked beans, and fries - only the fries were really good crispy shoestrings, I'd pass on the rest and just stick with wings. For sauce my fav is the habanero honey (not that spicy) and garlic parm. The bbq and sweet chili were pretty standard, but I also liked the wings just plain because they had seasoning already. 

Service was great and the tables were clean the 2 times that I've been, with guys coming out to wipe down tables as soon as they're free. I hate nickel and diming - they charge for ranch/blue cheese and extra sauce, but what can you do.

I also agree with others who've said that their chicken fingers are dry - stick with the wings.",2014/6/17,Henderson,-115.0729977,36.0721935,"['Chicken Wings', 'Restaurants']"

3,Taco Tijuana,"Taste is delicious. Much more flavourful and portions of protein are at least 2x that of La Matraca. (A bit spicy -- ask for no salsa or on the side if your tolerance is low) 

Although you can order single tacos, you'll probably want 2-4 (depending on if this is lunch/dinner). I can eat 3 for dinner (and be right on the edge before full-on stuffed) and my husband can eat 4. Prices are more than other taco places though, at about $3.50 per taco. (In contrast to La Matraca which is about $8 for 3 I believe). But because the portions are much more generous here, we might actually end up spending less because we need less tacos to fill us up. I recall typically eating 4 tacos and half a sandwich at La Matraca for dinner...

But.... Service is very slow and the business is fairly disorganized. We waited ~30 min for 5 tacos and were told to-go orders are also capped at 6 tacos. I think there were only 2 employees there --one person manning the counter/serving/bus service, and one person in the back cooking/grilling.

I've eaten at one of them. Noble's, and it was fantastic. But a bit pricier than I wanted my new husband to have to deal with. I saw a link to The King's Kitchen, and after checking out the website, I was in love. The food was very southern, but I was immediately drawn to the salmon AND what they do for the community. So, I told my husband about it, made the reservation and anticipated a delicious meal.

After our short & sweet wedding, we headed downtown for dinner. We had reservations, but they weren't incredibly busy, so we probably would have been fine without one. We were seated quickly and our server greeted us promptly. He took our drink orders, came back and we ordered a few appetizers for the table. We ordered the deviled eggs & the pimento cheese. I can't comment on the pimento cheese, since I don't care for it and didn't try it, but the eggs were delicious. He also brought out two plates of biscuits with homemade strawberry jam and cornbread. Everyone raved about the cornbread. I had a biscuit with some jam and it was delicious, but nothing special.

The entrees came out quickly and everyone was more than pleased. I had the salmon with the pea risotto, which was fantastic. The salmon had a lime butter on top and the risotto was perfect. And the color was gorgeous and interesting. I was very pleased with the flavors of this dish (the salmon was some of the best I've ever had). 

Several members of our table ordered the pot roast. I had a bite of my husband's and it melted in my mouth. I've never had a roast that was that tender and had such great flavor. My new mother in law had the fried flounder. I had a bite of that and it was incredible as well.
Everyone loved their side items (the mashed potatoes, creamed corn & macaroni and cheese were HUGE hits), and almost everyone was pleased with their entrees. My new brother in law ordered the fried chicken, and while it looked delicious, he said their was so much grease it actually became unappetizing the more he looked at it. 

Other than the fried chicken, the dinner was a huge success, and a fantastic evening was had by all. And while I loved my delicious dinner, I love what the restaurant does for the community and that just makes me want to go there over and over again.

Pretty small selections, seems as if there werent a lot of selections. I mostly ate the clams/mussels and they were DELICIOUS! They had the mini salad cup things next to the mussels and they were GOOD! well the one with the crumble cheese. The crab wasnt bad it was split in half so less hassle for us. Sushi was normal. Smoked salmon tasted like ham. The prime rib was pretty good. The custom made pasta need something im not sure what, but its cool how you can customize your own pasta.

1,Rosati's Pizza,"For some reason my co-workers continue to want to order food from this restaurant every Friday when the boss is buying. All free lunches have their tradeoffs, and for me, this one is no longer worth it. On a couple of occasions I have tried the individual pizzas, which taste a lot like the cardboard they come in. One of my office mates raves about the meat ravioli; tried that once and as another reviewer indicated, it tasted like it came out of a can. 

I am going out to lunch today and buying my own food (better to escape the smell of raw onions one of these ""ladies"" likes to cram onto her meatball sub). 

In the several times I have tried to order off this menu it seems like something listed doesn't actually exist in their restaurant. No, we don't have sun dried tomatoes; no, we don't have balsamic dressing... 

Today I thought I would just get a salad, but I didn't want the heavy garlicky dressing that they usually thrust upon you and asked for olive oil instead. I was advised they don't have olive oil. I understand maybe in this neighborhood the sun dried tomatoes aren't a popular item, that they might be out of balsamic (actually I don't really because, although they have been listed on the print and online menu for the last 8 months, they never have had those effing tomatoes). However, how can any Italian restaurant not have olive oil?

The descriptions for a couple of their dressings mention that they are made in house. Perhaps these people use canola oil in their dressings rather than olive oil, which sounds kind of Italian.

It was still really nice inside and the view I mean...come on. 

I got here early with my mom while we waited for the rest of my family and had a super good espresso martini. Then as my family arrived we were seated and began dinner.

I could not think of anything I would change about the time I dined here, and I can't wait to go back when my little brother graduates from college just to eat here again! So props to Bella Vista.",2013/11/17,Pittsburgh,-80.01828,40.438047,"['Restaurants', 'Italian']"
2,Gordon Ramsay Steak,"My wife and I had high expectations since we've seen Chef Gordon Ramsey's attention to detail on tv. Let's just call that Hollywood hype. The restaurant is in the Paris Hotel which is nice. We got there a bit early (8:30) for our 9:00 reservation and let the hostess know. She said it would be another 15 minutes and that we should wait at the bar. We decided to walk around instead and came back at 8:45. The same hostess says it will be another 15 minutes and again directs us to the bar. We walked around  until 9:00. The hostess says it will be a few more minutes as they are setting up the table before disappearing in the back. You can guess where she tried to send us before leaving. 10 minutes later, she reappears surprised to see that we haven't given up and gone to the bar. All the while there are 5 or 6 snobby hostesses just standing there.

Ok Vegas restaurants, listen up,.... pissing off your customers right off bat by lying to them about how long the wait will be as a weak-sauced ploy to get them to buy some $18.00 foo foo drinks at your bar is not a good start. Another hostess finally walked us in through the ""London Tunnel"" and pointed out the obnoxious red neon chaos on the ceiling (supposed to represent Chef Ramsey's hand movements). There was some loud 80's music playing and the decore looked like a club scene from Scarface.

We went with the basics since this is a steakhouse. My wife ordered the foie gras appetizer and I got the lobster stuffed with chorizo. The foie gras was ok, but it needed something else to balance the dish. My lobster was good but strange as appetizer (imagine tiny lobster tail with carrots). The entrees were the 8 oz wagyu eye and the 24 oz ribeye. The wagyu was good but the ribeye was flat and basic. Not what I was expecting. We finished the meal with a sticky toffee cake that was very good. Probably the best part of the meal. Overall, this place needs to lose the 5 snobby hostesses and 80's Studio 54 decor to focus on the food.",2015/9/20,Las Vegas,-115.1712704,36.11288234,"['Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'American (New)']"
3,SUSHISAMBA - Las Vegas,"I had high hopes for this place, mainly because my mother, who I've taken to many great places in Chinatown, went to Sushi Samba and claimed it was the best meal she's ever had. So even though I knew it was expensive, if she said it was worth it I was believing her. 

First off, it was crazy loud in the place, and it was very hard for us (especially my grandfather) to hear anything that was going on. But it's a strip restaurant I get it. We ordered drinks, oysters, and the heirloom tomato salad. I didn't eat much of any of those dishes, but for dinner we each ordered a roll: the neo Tokyo, sasa hand roll, and I had the chef special which was tempura shrimp, tuna, and cheese on top. All of the rolls were pretty bland and my roll was especially chewy with the cheese on top. (I knew sushi wasn't supposed to have cheese yet it sounded intriguing.) 

For other small plates we ordered the hamachi Kama, tempura green beans, and scallops with Peruvian corn which everyone raves about. The best by far was the tempura. I have never had Peruvian corn but it was very big and sort of hard. The scallops didn't have any taste. 

My biggest complaint about the restaurant is that we felt that they were constantly trying to take our plates away and clear the table. I understand it's a tapas restaurant so food comes quickly but once all our dishes were there they kept asking to clear plates that still had food on them. Just felt like they wanted to crank out as many tables as they could that night. They did end up giving us complimentary ice cream pops which was nice, but I don't think I'll be going back.

You also cannot go wrong with the Kaya burger, conch fritters, or the chicken entree.  The pulled pork quesadilla is pretty spicy, so if you don't like a lot of heat in your food, I would recommend against that.

There was a tiny bit of cheese and a lot of burrito sauce which just tasted like mayonnaise. As for vegetables there was only 2 skinny slices of roasted red pepper and a small amount of corn and black beans. Not much for a vegetarian burrito.

The duck pasta was consistently amazing, when I mix the running duck egg with the rest of the pasta, I feel like that's the moment that I worked so hard the entire week for.

5,Tamarind Savoring India,"We'd been meaning to try Tamarind for some time but didn't get around to it until this evening, and I am elated to tell you all that everything we had from starter to main to end was -- to put it simply -- a treat.

I am not Sherlock Holmes and thus am no expert on spices. My (damned) acid reflux also makes partaking in painfully high spice levels an act of poor judgement. I also like to taste what I am eating aside from seed-borne heat. The spice fiends of the Yelposphere who think that food is bland and worthless unless it deadens their tongues may scoff at my moderate intake of all things peppery, but I prefer my food to be a pleasure to consume, not an exercise in masochism. Having mentioned that, I found no issues with the pungency of what I ate.  

In regards to my entree, that being Lamb Korma, I asked for a 5 and got something that playfully nibbled at my tastebuds without overtaking the other components of the dish. Rich and succulent as a Hungarian ghoulash, the Korma reminded me of an even creamier interpretation of the more conventional (and famous?) Lamb Curry. A squiggly line of what I assume was yogurt was drizzled atop the gravy for presentation. The lamb, braised exquisitely, was as delicate and suety as the zenith of pulled pork. Exactly what spices were in the Korma, I couldn't tell you, but they were there, hiding underneath the buttery flavors and even permeating the avocado and walnut-colored room. Accentuating everything, usurping nothing, the essences were indescribable yet omnipresent. 

Kay's Tikka Masala cruised on a track parallel to the Korma, but included chicken, tomato, and onions to liven it up further. Kay was unable to finish her portion, so I...intervened. Both dishes were so luscious, when our excellent, friendly, and (interestingly enough) non-Indian server came by our table to see how our dinner was proceeding, I merely looked at her, closed my eyes, hummed, and swayed, much to her amusement and relief (the poor lass was dealing with a difficult party as we dined). 

Our first course consisted of the savorily tangy bread pudding vs. falafel of Dahi Vada. The fritters of lentil could have been a dessert had there been milk and sugar involved, but instead, both of the large ""fried donuts"" came to us in a pool of raita (a white yogurt sauce) and embellished with carrot shards and other vegetables. Velvety and served chilled, I felt that this would be the dish to serve with or after something particularly piquant. Nonetheless, the weightless patties were an ideal counterbalance to the entree.

Rather than go with Naan, that staple of Indian cuisine I've enjoyed countless times, I opted for its billowy, crisp, hot fat-baptized variant in Batura. The most savorous fried dough in all of gastronomy, the gilded bread itself was feather-light, had bubbles all through it, and revealed a hollow interior when pulled apart to dip into and soak up whatever we pleased. If any Indian restaurant decided to open a booth at a carnival, they'll do well to make plenty of Batura for it is fair food that is at once familiar and exotic. I have had Batura before, but it had been so long that I had forgotten what it was called. Tonight's dinner was a pleasant and decadent refresher course on this Asiatic sopapilla. 

I almost went with an Indian dessert such as Rasmalai to conclude the evening's experience, but when I found out that Tamarind makes their own cakes in their own bakery, I just had to take a pop at one. Feeling like chocolate cake (Tamarind has a wide assortment), we each went for just that and were pleased to find that it was moist, constructed ornately with multiple layers, ethereal in texture, and iced with an equally airy coffee-tinged frosting that resembled mousse. We were assured by our server that Tamarind does not buy their cakes elsewhere, and I am still trying to tell myself that I did in fact have myself a truly blissful cut of chocolate cake...from an Indian restaurant.  How common is that? 

Savoring India, indeed. Drive up that winding road to find the hidden shopping plaza in the suburban sky and deliver thyselves unto culinary Vaikuntha.",2012/12/3,Pittsburgh,-80.0724608,40.3905672,"['Bakeries', 'Restaurants', 'Pakistani', 'Food', 'Indian']"

And the expensive meat our waitress was in the process of cooking - burnt.

From inside out they tried to use the same ingredients/noodles as their original store in Japan(even the same style of bowl in blue, and the quantity of noodle, pork etc......)

I was looking into the kitchen to see how they cook the noodle, and find out that the chef didn't drain out all the excess water after they cook the noodle, which is one of the key factor of affecting the texture of it.

The soup base is ok, not the best comparing to Sansotei, love the combo that comes with a bowl of rice with salmon roe on it, although a little pricy for that.  The pork is good too, very tender and juicy.

Location is perfect, the area was missing a nice roof top patio. It's spacious, full of servers and they're all mad nice.

The only problem is the lineup. Friday night, any time after 6pm - GOOD LUCK getting a seat anywhere in the restaurant, and you can forget about the roof top all together.

5,Veggie House,"I loved this place.

The service was amazing for casual dining. The ladies all helped us, were constantly smiling, and always checked up on us. They refilled drinks promptly, they took requests for sharing plates and napkins quickly. It truly was a great first experience.

I've heard great things about ""fake meat"". I've heard that their are delicious fried chicken sandwiches at Veggie places that rival the real thing.

I willingly tried out veggie house for lunch with two friends.

They have a large menu of vegan and vegetarian dishes. Many of them feature tofu, veggies, and ""fake meat"". Sorry I can't figure out a better sounding phrase.

Anyways their lunch special comes with soup, brown or white rice, and an entree. I don't remember the price but the lunch portions of the items were big! I want to say it was $7-$8 for their lunch special.

Between the here of us we had beef and broccoli, Kung pao beef, and their famous crispy beef.

All of the entrees were served with their traditional veggies. Like the Kung pao had water chestnuts, onions, ect,

The veggies on my beef and broccoli were a large portion. All of their ingredients are fresh. 

And let me get to the meat. Upon first bite it truly is a great substitute to meat. It really does taste relatively close to the real thing. They have the texture right. All of the dishes had the same traditional flavors you'd expect. The crispy beef was the least like beef IMO since it is fried it tasted more like fried batter. It was still tasty. Their brown rice was cooked perfectly. The soup had a very mild flavor. It was like a veggie broth.

Last we had a vegan pumpkin cheesecake. It was a good ending to the meal. It was light, sweet, and pumpkiny. I still prefer regular cheesecake.

Am I a convert? No. It did make me rethink all the salt and meat I eat. Will I come back here and was the food good? Yes! 

This is a five star restaurant. Good service, good food quality, unique, good prices, clean.",2014/1/6,Las Vegas,-115.2115631,36.12539669,"['Food', 'Vegan', 'Specialty Food', 'Vegetarian', 'Restaurants', 'Chinese']"

I'm not a chain gal and would never say that Denny's and IHOP have delicious pancakes. With that said...MTO does make a great pancake. I had the lemon poppyseed pancakes with blueberry and ginger compote (ask for extra compote) and a cup of coffee. The pancakes werent too sweet or oily, almost a muffin consistency.

You get the idea. Maybe they're experimenting, getting to know their market or the price of food is an ever-rising climb. Whatever it is, it's just too many changes in such a short period of time that I can't really trust that they won't continue to eliminate specials, change the menu, or raise the prices.

1,Shiloh Grill,"My last review is, to this day, still the worst review I have given for the worst service I have ever received. Shiloh Grill has proved a disappointment yet again and this review still stands true. Now that we live on Mount Washington (we moved about 5 months ago) I have been avoiding it due to our previous visit. Today our friend suggested it so 4 of us went out together. It wasn't busy, many open tables but we sat outside which also had many open tables. After getting our water, our waiter said he'd be back to take our orders. I ordered first and asked for the calamari. He said they were out. I actually began to laugh thinking it was a joke due to our last visit. Before anyone spoke he said, ""we just had a table of 80 and they cleared us out on food."" Please tell me why you wouldn't tell us this right when we sat down, not nearly 20 minutes later? My boyfriend then said, ""what do you have? I was going to get the weasel (or something titled that, I just know it was a portobello sandwich), do you have that?"" Our wait told us they did not have that and really were ""out of everything"". This was the second time I gave Shiloh Grill a chance and I WILL NEVER GO BACK. Why is your kitchen open if you have no food? I understand large parties. But a party of 80? You weren't prepared? Even so, you should have food for 80 people in a night. I have worked years in the restaurant business so I understand issues beyond control but to not tell us when you gave us a menu? Maybe the owners of Shiloh Grill should worry more about customer service and actually being a worthy restaurant than all of their unoriginal and frankly worthless puns that fall extremely short just like their service and their food. I truly think this is a joke. At least they're consistent.

The food itself is pretty decent for a budget shop!  No complaints on the food other than it often takes a little bit of time, isn't always right (ie. they don't bring what you ordered they bring something else all together) and they lack a bit of the variety a few other places have.

If you are looking for a fine dinning experience - this is NOT your place.  If you are craving sushi, have 10 bucks in your pocket and a little bit of time, stop in!  We frequently quite regularly - despite the bad service the quality is consistent.

Last time we dinned in we did NOT leave a tip due to the insanity that was the service (no service, had to walk from back of restaurant to front of restaurant 3 times to fetch a server - didn't bring what we ordered even though we ordered by the item name not menu number, hard to mix that one up, took an exceeding amount of time to make/deliver food, the days wait staff were quite kirt) upon paying the woman taking our money had the audacity to say ""oh...mam you didn't include a tip, give me your card back and we'll do it again""  A tip is not a legal right, it's an earned reward!

2,Crown Prince Fine Dining & Banquet,"I suggest reading the 3-star reviews and below on Crown Prince before you decide to go, because I paid more attention to the 3-star and above reviews and after my experience there I feel that I should've taken my own suggestion to avoid a colossal letdown. 

Yesterday was my first time visiting this restaurant and I picked an awesome day to try it out: Chinese New Year Day!  I actually went early in the morning before they opened their doors at 9:00 AM, and there was already a line up!  As soon as the doors open people just started flooding in and I knew at that point not to expect too much on this visit.

I ordered 5 items of dim sum and the last one arrived at my table almost 1 hour  after I had placed the order. Maybe it was a special dish they make in batches at a certain time. It was the crispy pumkin with mushroom something-something.  Anyways, one minute after that dish arrived at my table, one of the managers came up to me and said that I had to pay my bill soon cuz I've been sitting for over an hour and I can't take my sweet time to eat  cuz it was new years.  Of course, this conversation happened in Cantonese. I thought to myself, WTF?  I understand they wanna turn tables but there's a better way to ask.  Some restaurants place the bill on your table and say thank you.  

If that conversation hadn't happened, I would've given this restaurant a three-star at most just for the food and somewhat okay service.  To be fair, there was an older manager who seems to have more experience in the restaurant business that was more helpful.  When I was looking around to flag someone, he took notice and  came up to my table to ask me what I needed. I'm not going to blow this incident out of proportion but it definitely leaves a bad taste in my mouth to be accused of squatting when I was waiting for the last dish to come out. It's not my fault their kitchen is slow.

That issue aside, the food is okay and they're priced okay as well at $2.80 for S, M, L and they have some unique items on their menu.  I noticed a lot of pumpkin based dim sum and I really wanted to try the puff pastry durian dessert thing but I didn't get the chance cuz the manager that tried to kick me out totally spoiled my mood.  

Finally, don't let the decor fool you. This restaurant is not as ""upscale"" as it looks; it's all a facade to make people feel comfortable about paying more for what is essentially less.  Fortunately, it doesn't work on me.  That's why I chose to go for dim sum.  I would be dumb to order off of their dinner menu. When you strip away the decor, it exposes the real substance of the restaurant and there's really not much there to differentiate this restaurant from others.  

On a side note, I wish restaurants like Crown Prince and Casa Imperial (possibly related or sharing notes) could be more original with their decor.  Some people associate this classic style with ""upscale"" and ""elegance"" but it looks out of place to me in the 21st century.  Note to the owners of Crown Prince: if you're gonna open another restaurant, please for the sake of this city take notes from the restaurants in Asia who have mastered the art of modern elegance and do your part in bringing Chinese restaurants in Toronto up to the 21st century--not down.

Bottom line, food is acceptable and the prices for dim sum are reasonable, which is probably why this place is busy, but everything else is lacking.  I most likely won't go back.",2013/2/11,Toronto,-79.33846048,43.80653245,"['Chinese', 'Restaurants', 'Dim Sum']"

If you have money to spend, want a greasy full of flavor burger, milk shakes to die for... this is honestly the place. Whenever I go I always spent $25. A burger avg is about 12.99 a special fry platter 5.99 and a milkshake and drink. 

I tend to experience the whole experience at this place because I go here once in every couple of months but when I do I go all out.

All of the few times she came to the table she was pretty friendly and personable. We wanted water and extra sides of sauce and had to stop other people to ask for it. Our food wasn't terrible but it wasn't good enough to want to go back. Our server never once checked on us during our entr??e. When she finally did come back, we asked for a box bc we wanted to go, another 15 min to get that. I found a manager on the way to the bathroom and told him I was not impressed and probably would not be back. The worst part: he knew who our server was! Before I could even say her name. That. is. awful. If someone messes up that often, she should no longer work there or fill a hostess position.

The waitress was either playing with her phone all night or talking to the gentleman at the bar, After given a menu, waitress did not come back for another 10 minutes. Ordered. Appetizer arrived and was not served plates so ate off the board. A Chipotle Chicken  panini took over 30 minutes to come out, with the wrong side order and a ton of onions and instead of correcting it - just took it because I was sick of waiting.

5,Rollin Smoke Barbeque,"Vegas is such a minefield as far as its restaurants are concerned, with so many meals beginning with high expectations but ending in disappointment, that I wanted to say a few words about a place that I feel is one of the absolute gems of the Vegas culinary landscape.

I've eaten at Rollin' Smoke BBQ twice now, and left both times feeling as though I'd eaten some of the best BBQ of my life. I'm a true lover of good BBQ and have even taken pilgrimages to places like Memphis, TN and Lockhart, TX in search of the country's best. I feel I have a good frame of reference for evaluating what good BBQ tastes like, and, let me assure you, Rollin' Smoke is damned good BBQ!

Everything I've tried on the menu has been excellent, but the dishes I dream about are the smoked meatloaf--which I have to say may be the single best meatloaf dish I've ever eaten--and the burnt ends, waffle fries and corn fritters. The ribs, chicken and everything else is excellent, but the above dishes were my favorites.

Las Vegas is frankly very lucky to have BBQ of this caliber, as very few cities in America do. The manager is super friendly, and the whole staff is very friendly and accommodating. They also give a discount to locals, showing that they appreciate those of us who live here and support these businesses on a regular basis.

I know I'm going to leave with a smile on my face every time I eat here, and I cannot recommend this place highly enough. Unlike many on Yelp, I don't give out five-star ratings easily, but Rollin' Smoke has earned it! Please support this great Las Vegas restaurant!

5,Coronado Cafe,"Phoenix's foodie scene is in full bloom, and the Coronado Cafe is the best in the bundle.  Coronado prides itself on excellent ingredients, delicious recipes, and fantastic service and it delivers on all counts. This is one of my favorite places in central Phoenix.

Coronado has a stunning dinner menu, a lighter but still delicious lunch offering, and hosts a Saturday and Sunday brunch that is probably my personal favorite. Everything Coronado serves up, from its pepper-crusted sirloin with carmelized jalapenos and onions to their cafe meatloaf with sauteed pepper, squash, mushroom, and a balsamic reduction, to their home-made sticky buns on Saturday mornings is to die for. 

My only words of caution would be that first, it's a rather small and intimate space - groups of four at the most are recommended.",2009/2/18,Phoenix,-112.0648061,33.4713153,"['Restaurants', 'Tacos', 'American (New)', 'Sandwiches', 'Mexican']"

2,Due Forni,"I went for the first time on Friday night with my boyfriend and our friend.  2 beers, 2 glasses of wine, mozarella, a salad and a pizza for $74.  The price point was too high for our taste.

The place has a cool vibe.  We sat outside, under the heat lamps, and had a laugh over the bright orange plastic chairs, which reminded all of us of the chairs in elementary school.  The dark wood, which so many people find ""modern"" is straight out of the late 60s, early 70s, especially with the ""burnt orange"" chairs.  My aunt's fridge was the same exact color.

The service was awesome, as one would expect it to be in a new restaurant.  Everyone was VERY knowledgeable and helpful, which we greatly appreciated.

We split the panzanella salad, which was fine, but certainly not spectacular. We did all appreciate the freshness of the ingredients.  

We then split a classica mozarella bar with the artichoke hearts.  The mozarella was good, the artichoke hearts were completely underwhelming.  The quantity of them was sad, sad, sad, and they were very lightly seasoned (to put it mildly, we found it bland.)

Last, our pizza.  We had the Prosciutto e Rucola on the Neopolitan crust, as was recommended by our server.  The crust was the perfect blend of crunchy and chewy, the prosciutto was plentiful, and the flavor was, well, pretty bland.  There was so little smoked mozarella that I don't think I even had a bite of it on my slice.  

We contemplated desserts, but with only 3 choices, and none of them all that appealing to us, we decided against it.  

We were kinda bummed by the lack-luster performance, as we frequently walk to Rachel's for breakfast and lunch, and Hokkaido for dinner, and we were excited to have a cool place to hang out and eat some tasty food.  But the reality is, for the price and the mediocre food, I don't see us going there again any time soon.  

I much prefer going to Nora's on Flamingo and Jones for salad, pizza and wine.  Their food is superior, and I don't leave there hungry.",2011/3/7,Las Vegas,-115.3252217,36.1248405,"['Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Pizza', 'Italian', 'Wine Bars', 'Restaurants']"

3,Surco Peruvian Cuisine,"This is a tough one. I live in the neighborhood and I love Peruvian food and this food was as good as I've had. I had the chicken sandwich with tacu tacu and it was awesome. The chicken was perfect: super moist and perfectly seasoned. The whole sandwich was sort of a piece of art. It's clear that whoever is in the kitchen takes pride in their work and has the chops of a chef and not a line cook. The interior was also very comfortable and a huge upgrade from the previous business.

All that being said, I was in complete disbelief at the pricing. I won't say that the food wasn't worth it, but in this neighborhood, at that location, in this town, I don't see this working. My chicken sandwich was just about the least expensive item on the menu at $13. Most of the entrees were $16-25 and I think dessert (also amazing) was $8 or $9. I had my two sons along and they actually had two items available in a children's section. They both got the salchipapas (hot dog and fries) for $8. To be fair, they did serve a really nice squash soup to each of us included with our entrees.

I'm not sure who's behind the business side of the restaurant, but I have a feeling they have some restaurant experience in a big city. They seem a little out of touch with the Madison scene. Most places with really good food have sandwiches available in the $8-10 range with entrees in the $9-13 range. You really need to venture downtown to start pushing these kind of prices and you need to have a location that isn't a rundown, nondescript, white house.

I don't think there's any way this model is going to work at this location. Besides one couple at the end of our stay, we were the only diners between 5:45-6:45 on a Friday night. I do think a restaurant (and even a Peruvian restaurant) could be successful here, but it's going to need to be able to serve it's surrounding neighborhoods. The people around here just aren't gonna opt for these prices, regardless of the food quality. Bring your prices down to match what's available on Atwood and think about the lunch crowd too. Reasonably priced sandwiches to go would have a strong market at that location. I really want to support you guys and this should be a regular joint for my family of four, but at these prices, it ain't happenin'.",2013/12/21,Madison,-89.317665,43.08356,"['Restaurants', 'Peruvian']"

2,Panera Bread,"Seriously, people, five stars for Panera Bread?  Y'all don't get out enough.

So far as I can tell, Panera is a pseudo-trendy food stand aimed at the same suburban yuppies that shop for music from Starbucks and proudly drive Ford Escape Hybrids.  The pastries are decent at best but incredibly overpriced.  You can get donuts and cookies that are just as good for less than half the price at the Giant Eagle across the street.   And how about the food?  Decent soup, shitty little sandwiches, and again (as if it's a dominant theme), incredibly overpriced.

I guess that mark-up is for the ""hip""-ness factor?

Panera always reminds me of eating lunch in elementary school, back when those Lunchable things were fashionable.  I begged and begged my mom to buy me those things for my lunch because they were cool, but once I actually ate it, I felt cheated and unfulfilled.

2,Shake Shack,"Ney York, is this all you got? I can't believe people are comparing this place to In-N-Out Burger. You can get a Double-Double combo for about $6 bucks at In-N-Out while a Double Shack Burger is $8 bucks a la carte. 

I ordered the Shack Stack which is the cheeseburger with the cheese stuffed mushroom all in one. $10 bucks. 

Burger was too salty. I couldn't taste the meat due to the giant battered and cheesy stuffed mushroom overpowering the meat. So the meat to cheese to bun ratio was way off in this burger. Does not live up to my expectation of what a $10 dollar burger should taste like.

Girlfriend ordered the double Smoke Shack: Double bacon cheeseburger. $10 bucks.

Burger again was too salty. She got 2 patties so this time the meat to bun ratio was much better. The pickled red peppers with its acidity balanced well with the richness of the melted cheese and bacon. Not a bad burger but not a $10 dollar burger by any means.

Fries: Probably the highlight of the meal. These are crinkle cut fries with just the right amount of crunch on the outside and they are thick enough that you get some chewy potato on the inside. Decent sized portion for $3 bucks.

Summary: Burgers are overpriced by $4 bucks. If you're comparing this to In-N-Out then do yourself a favor and get In-N-Out, you get the same size/type of burger at the price that it's worth. 

If I was to spend $10 on a burger, then I'd go to Bachi Burger instead. Take notes Shack Shack, Bachi Burger is what a $10 burger should look and taste like.

2,CK's Tavern & Grill,"My husband and I have been coming to CK's for a few years.  I must admit, it has declined over the years.  A Bar Rescue is in order.  Recently on our last few visits we have noticed an increasing displacement in our experience.  Last night was the defining experience to seek yelp to express our displacement. 
Here are some of our dislikes:  The food is not fresh.
1.  We ordered the potato skins.  they were not fully cooked and very dry- difficult to cut and chew.  We returned them -the 2nd plate replacing them were still difficult to eat they were dry. 
2. We ordered the meat loaf dinner.  the meatloaf was dry and the barbecue sauce used on it was so bitter and too spicy to eat. the mashed potatoes listed on the menu were not the mashed potatoes served.  The mashed potatoes were plain and tasted bland. 
3.  The server appearance was unkept.  hair unkept and clothing not professional.  The server was inexperienced and did not pay attention to our needs. We witnessed her walking in circles through her section and not checking in with her customers.  food not brought out in a timely fashion.   We ordered our drinks and she forgot my husband's drink and we sat and waited until she came over.  She did not clear off our table after serving us, leaving dirty plates and paper on our table.  
4.  The Bar and seating area appeared dirty and unkept. behind the bar it appeared unkept and unorganized. 

I hope the owners read this and find a solution 
Both my husband and I have decided to not return after this recent experience.",2014/3/29,Phoenix,-111.9932433,33.3058134,"['Sports Bars', 'Sandwiches', 'Restaurants', 'Bars', 'American (Traditional)', 'Barbeque', 'Nightlife']"
4,Chaya Japanese Cuisine,"SETTING:
Probably the most authentic Japanese as you can get in Pittsburgh. From the get-go, I noticed the flower arrangements, the wooden tables and furniture, and the Japanese music lightly playing in the background. Chaya was beautiful and the establishment made quite the impression. The traditional decor and warm atmosphere was exactly what I needed to help me relax and enjoy some Japanese comfort food. 

FOOD:
We shared the Regular Sushi & Sashimi Combination. The course starts with a miso soup and small salad, then a small karaage (japanese fried chicken). Finally the platter comes out, an assortment of sashimi (tuna, salmon, shrimp, etc) and california rolls. 

Miso soup and salad were pretty standard, as they should be. I love chicken karaage, so I was a bit disappointed that it was a bit small (four bite-sized pieces). That being said, they do a great job with creating a tender and juicy appetizer. The Sushi and Sashimi combo definitely featured fresh and good quality sashimi and sushi. Overall, it's not exactly filling if you're sharing between two hungry people, but is is a perfectly light dinner. 

SERVICE:
Kind and professional staff. They are very attentive and come by when every dish is served to ask how we like it and if we need more water. I believe all the waitresses and the sushi chef are Japanese as well, and they were very gentle and created a wonderful dining experience for us.

IMPRESSIONS:
As much as my hungry stomach may disagree, particularly when it hijacks my mind's sound decision-making, I'm always about quality over quantity. Chaya is quality. Not just the food, but from top to bottom. The atmosphere, the staff, and of course, their dishes all create a remarkable casual dining experience.",2015/3/4,Pittsburgh,-79.923134,40.4338841,"['Restaurants', 'Japanese', 'Sushi Bars', 'Soup']"

All items were good, but the butcher's platter was the winner. For two people, it worked out well. We definitely could have gone without the pretzel bites, but oh well!

2,Rubio's Coastal Grill,"My family has enjoyed Rubio's for many years. I give an extra star for our previous experiences at other locations, but this location has provided two bad experiences.

We picked it up and took it home, only to find out there were no tortillas! We had to drive several miles back for more. Last night was our second poor experience with this location. I observed a customer returning a wrongly made order. I ordered cheese enchiladas with rice and beans. I am vegetarian and do not enjoy meat (one of the reasons I love Rubios). My enchilada was served to me stuffed full of chicken. I returned the order and was given a replacement plate with cheese enchiladas. Looking forward to my meal, finally, I started to eat. They were out of forks so i had to use a spoon. The rice was half-cooked and still crunchy, and did not seem to have any flavor. My companion ordered cheese nachos and the serving size was much smaller than it is served at our preferred location.

While waiting, I took in the surroundings. The restaurant has very solid decor, further accentuating its strong personality. 

The burger itself was fantastic. I was pleasantly surprised by the caramelized jalape??os in my burger and added another level of flavour.

Oh man, I'd like to take home a gallon of that - but it might eat its way through whatever container it was put in...Hmm. The sides are delightful, especially the bourbon baked beans. How can that not be good? Home made goodness like all the other sides and you can clearly tell. The cole slaw is amazing and so is the potato salad.

But what makes this place is the people here. The whole team seems genuinely committed to making sure things are done right, that the food is top notch and that the service is exactly what you'd expect. The manager is a pure delight and she is super friendly. After being in business only 3 months they seemed to have hit a good stride and have things cranking very well.

5,Switch Restaurant & Wine Bar,"I'm ranking this primarily on the food and what I think is some great potential... also based on the fact that I really want them to do well.

Anyway, I've been to Switch I think five or six times now in the past month (whenever I'm in Phoenix for work) mainly because it's about 2 blocks from the office. I've done both take-out and dine-in, and have only come away with questionable service once. Even then, the food is spot-on. In the evenings, the whole area is sorta dead, especially with the light-rail construction, so I'm sure that's not helping out. But the several times I've been there for lunch, it's been pretty packed and have even had to wait for a table once or twice (just a few minutes).

So, so far...

Appetizers:
- Garlic hummus. the waiter says it's ""kick ass,"" and it was. Love the roasted pepper and artichokes on the side
- Turkey Mac'n'Cheese. Wasn't my favorite, but pretty creamy nonetheless.

Salads and Soup:
-Sangria Salad with chicken (you can add chicken, beef, turkey, ham, tuna salad, salmon, or lobster salad to any of the salads). Anyway, rather fruity with grapes, apples, and strawberries. Great flavor combination.
-Super Chop Salad with lobster. Stuff is just piled on. Love it.
In general, the salads are pretty big and filling. Only gotten the soup of the day (which changes regularly as the name implies). Had a duck and mushroom soup the other day. A little on the salty side, but I can't say no to duck and mushroom in anything.

Entrees:
- Puff Pastry Galletes. Have tried the prosciutto, mozzarella, pesto and tomato galette which is mouth-watering, as well as the - Chicken Pot Pie Gallete. Chicken pot pie may be one of my favorite things in the world, and this definitely hits the spot.
They also have savory crepes, a pasta, and meat and fish dishes.


Sandwiches:
- Ibiza Sangria Chicken. Friend ordered this, but the waitress was a little frazzled it seemed, so we ended up getting the sangria salad instead. Problem was corrected pretty quickly. Maybe she was new. Anyway, sandwich looked good (roast chicken with apples, grapes, goat cheese, etc.)
- Eastport Lobster Roll. Lobster and seafood salad, roast corn and other veggies. Clean flavors, very refreshing
- Parmesan Caesar Turkey Pita - basically a caesar salad with roast turkey and tomato, stuffed in a pita. Pretty good, but the turkey was just a tad salty for my tastes.

Oh yeah, love their cookies too. They have some and other simple stuff at the honor bar, so you just take and pay in a jar. See how much they trust you? :D Even then, the staff have given me free cookies here and there while waiting or when we got a wrong order once.

Anyway, you can see I've tried a good sampling of their menu, but there are like 10 other entrees, about 20 sandwiches, and a handful of other appetizers and salads, not to mention an entire breakfast menu, plus more cocktails, coffees, italian sodas, and smoothies. Maybe their tactic is to get someone like me to come in and eventually try everything on the menu.

3,Crooked River BBQ + Beer,"What a huge disappointment from what the original used to be as Old Carolina BBQ.

Come to find out the original franchisee left the owner and started his own in the exact same location,  exact same equipment, same recipes. Got sued, lost the battle and now uses his own poor substitute  recipes.

The pulled pork was dry yet had large chunks of fat cap that should have been removed before it was shredded. ( we bought two pounds of pulled pork to go. ) These pieces of fat cap were almost the size of the palm of your hand. The BBQ sauces are very poor imitations of the original company's sauce. They have some really weird ideas about a cherry barbecue sauce and the mustard sauce is not nearly as good as the original.

Was looking forward to their Apple coleslaw but it too was a far cry from what we expected. the only bright spot was the super yummy cornbread, it was my favorite but my wife thought it was way too oily didn't like it at all.

3,Popo's Mexican Food,"I hate to say it, but my recent 5 star review is coming down.  Why?  Well,  something bad is going on at Popo's.  On our last two visits we were underwhelmed with the service and the very last time we went (only 3 days ago) the food was sub-par as well.  We know they are in the process of opening a second location and hope that this sudden decline in awesomeness is due to that situation.  Don't know, but until things improve, I'm gonna not drive out of my way to visit.  Such a pity, as this place had amazing Sonoran style Mexican food.  My favorite thing on the menu was their incredible authentic rice which was undercooked and just plain not good on Friday night.  My next favorite thing is their salsa which tasted fine but was not properly prepared (huge chunks of uncleaned peppers and big pieces of cilantro) so it was off putting.  

Oh, please, will the Mexican Food Gods of Phoenix not let Popo's suffer the same failures as so many of their sister/brother mexican/american restaurants have suffered?  Seems like once they expand, the thing that made them so fantastic in the first place is lost forever.

4,Hooters Eastern,"This is a relatively new Hooters location. It took over the building from another bar/restaurant/gaming establishment. It's clean. The booths in the bar area are comfy and nice. The server was friendly, but she didn't know the different beer options and didn't seem familiar with the menu. Their uniforms also looked a bit sloppy. And when I said I wanted both ranch and blue cheese for the dipping sauces, I got one sauce cup with both ranch and blue cheese in it. (Is that a thing? I've never had that happen elsewhere before.) I was pleasantly surprised with the food as it was far better than the one other Hooters location I went to years ago. FAR better. I now think of Hooters very differently. The wing sauces are actually hot and spicy. The breaded wings (which were a complete icky, inedible disaster the one time I went to a different Hooters) were cooked perfectly. They had a good crunch and were well-coated in the sauce. Tip: The spicy garlic sauce is a real winner. The Daytona wings were good (unbreaded and grilled), but the sauce was too mild and BBQ-ish for me. The fries were cooked perfectly. The cheese sauce was good. The ranch and blue cheese dipping sauces left something to be desired, but weren't terrible. The original (breaded) wings and fries were a big hit - and they earn this place 4 stars. Plus, we were checked on frequently by both our server and a manager-type. So all in all, I'm kind of a fan of Hooters now. Those were some tasty wings.",2015/7/17,Henderson,-115.1069969,36.00155756,"['American (Traditional)', 'Restaurants', 'Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Sports Bars', 'Chicken Wings']"

If I could give this zero stars I would because it is a sad excuse for a restaurant. They were out of cream cheese at 8AM, but they had butter and jelly which you had to put on your own bagel. That would have been fine had they not charged me for the cream cheese anyway (even though I questioned it). The cashier was super curt with us despite there being nobody else in the line. 

They ""toasted"" my bagel in a panini press, which squished it down flat and made it taste like sliced bread. I also ordered coffee, which was below average. The worst part was probably that the lid to the cup was super flimsy (clear plastic that bent every time the cup changed shape, so that when I went to pick up the cup, coffee spilled all over my hands (and I couldn't put the lid on tighter or readjust it).

1,Bazaar Meat by Jos?? Andr??s,"We made reservations for dinner around 7pm for 2 people (my husband and I). The place was busy but not full. At first glance we were loving the open kitchen and different stations set ups. That was until they took us to the very back station, the only one that is closed off, and sat us at a big table for just the two of us. We were the only ones in the room, at a big table in the middle of the room, we just felt awkward. 

Our server was very knowledgeable and friendly but she seemed to have been busy outside of the seafood room that we were located in. We sat for a long time with nothing on our table and the flow of food was off and weird. We were told that the food would come out as it was ready and then the cold Brussels were one of the last things that we were served. Even the table next to us ( that got sat after us) complained about not receiving any of their dishes. 

We ordered 8 ""shared"" items. Some items were only a bite, some were to ""share"" and then the steaks were huge. This concept was weird for us. The 8 items we ordered plus two dessert ""bites"" and a coffee our bill was $170! If we would've ordered a steak 20oz plus would've been over $120. We completely understand sharing and the idea of that is great but maybe this restaurant isn't for 2 people but maybe geared for larger parties. 

We started with the cotton candy foie gras, that was fun and unique. The Ruben was probably our favorite thing, full of flavor and different. We did have to order two of rubens just so we could both try it. The sloppy joes were anything to brag about. The Asian tacos aren't worth your time, the iberico was improperly sliced and was placed on top of just a slice of nori. The blood sausage with uni was under seasoned, this dish you were given 5 bites. As I mentioned before the placement of the dishes were strange, out last two courses were the corn and Brussels we ordered. The Brussels were cold and didn't have enough acid in them. $15 for a bowl of cold Brussels, no thanks. The last dish we received was the corn, a take on Mexican corn. The flavor was there but I could've used a lime or some salt to add to it. 

Dessert was brought out on a serving platter and you got to pick what you wanted which was different and fun. We were celebrating my husbands birthday so our server brought out an extra dessert for him Which was very thoughtful. 

Overall we were disappointed, maybe we should've gotten the suckling pig because that is their featured item. We like to go out to eat and order a lot of things to share and try new things. Not a spot for that without spending a lot. 

If we were to come back it would be to get the ""Vaca vieja"" with the hopes that we could sit in the actual dining room and enjoy that ambiance.",2016/11/17,Las Vegas,-115.1578748,36.1427564,"['Steakhouses', 'Spanish', 'Restaurants', 'Tapas/Small Plates']"

I've always been hesitant to going to Smash Burger cause I always heard ""Oh expensive"" haha what!? Not even expensive.  Dumb non-yelpers haha jk.  I could have been eating smash burger for the 100th time not just 2nd. Oops I just saw a few yelpers say it's expensive, they're cool.  I think they're still kind of cheap for a good burger but yes a little expensive for a chain burger place especially if you throw in the add ons that aren't free.  When you go to Smash Burger do yourself a favor and just get the Sin City Smash Burger which already has a fried egg, bacon, American cheese, grilled onions, haystack onion and the smash sauce and play around with the free add ons.  I liked mine with the spicy mayo and jalapenos.  You don't always have to build your own burger that's when it gets pricey.  The fries are real good too. In and Out is good but I like Smash Burger (burgers and fries) more.

The curry was fantastic but the tom kha was not my favorite ever (though it has some stiff competitors from my home back east).

2,LongHorn Steakhouse,"So I want to take my Dad out for his Birthday and this place had recently opened so he wanted to try it. I called the place around 12:30 on a  Saturday (used the yelp app) and asked if we could have a reservation for eight at 4:30. Was told yes and the woman who answered the phone asked for my name. Good so we are set then. Wrong!

We get there around 4:20 and I let them know I have a reservation and give the hostess my name. She gives me a confused look and says they don't take reservations! Well, who did I speak to four hours earlier?!? She tells me they have to put tables together so we have to wait fifteen minutes. Okay. While waiting there was another party in the same boat, thought they had a reservation but don't. Very organized this place.

We get seated, server comes to take our drink order, all well and good. She comes back and spills water down my wife's back. An accident and she was very apologetic. We give our orders and the food arrives. I had the renegade sirloin medium well with mashed potatoes. The steak was okay, I have had both better and worse at chain steakhouses. The mashed potatoes were excellent. Very buttery but the portion was on the smaller side especially for the price. My Dad got  some sort of chicken meal that I cannot recall and he mentioned it was bland. My Mother liked her baby back ribs. My wife had the crusted Parmesan chicken and found it tasty and juicy.

The manager showed up in the middle do dinner and apologized to my wife for the water spilling. No comped dinner for her or maybe even a desert, nope, sorry for the water spilled down your back at the beginning of dinner, but enjoy! Our server seemed saddled with too many tables and didn't check on out table too often. When she gave us the check, it was for the wrong table and it took awhile to get us the correct check. 

The reservation issue stilled bothered me so as we were leaving, I opened my yelp app and it was still on the longhorn site it was earlier. I called the number and, yep, it was the Longhorn we were just at so I didn't just imagine I had actually made reservations there.

All in all a bad experience. It is located in a neighborhood that has seen much better days and has competition from a Texas Roadhouse just down the street. My family won't be back.",2014/1/5,Phoenix,-112.2201167,33.474232,"['Restaurants', 'Barbeque', 'Steakhouses', 'American (Traditional)']"

Their winter fries: purple potato are unbeatable.  I love them so much, I've attempted duplicating the recipe at home. The secret is malt vinegar and salt overnight, so I've been told.

4,Anthony's Prime Steak & Seafood,"Never been inside the M Resort.  Twas 'bout time I explored the SE part.  Dark outside on the drive over, but had no idea homes existed out there.  Lights are so pretty at night, and you can tell there's still lotsa space to develop the area.

Intended to have dinner at the M.  No clue where or what.  In a hoodie, jeans, & Old Navy moccasins, wandered into Anthony's feeling like seafood for dinner.  It's a formal white tablecloth dining atmosphere.  I'm feeling awkward but who's stink-eyeing me?

We ended up with a really cool waiter, Mario.  Timing to get our orders in was a little wait.  But I saw they were juggling a few tables and a few waiters were tending to us all.  Was cool since my new Yelp BFF and I had a chance to catch up on our lives.  Yeah we were ""badged"" by Yelp during this dinner :D

Da Luca Prosecco was a perfect choice since we were having seafood.  Aroma, flavor, sparkling fizz, bottle design, presentation - they poured and refilled for us although it was kept in a tall ice stand tableside.  Told you formal dining.

I had the Pan Seared Blackened Sea Bass.  The sea bass almost reminded me of fresh steamed seasoned king crab legs meat.  If I could spend this kinda money every week, I'd repeat this dinner!  Soooo excellently delicious!  

The sea bass was on a bed of steamed vegetables which I like to call a hot salad.  Something to do with the flavor in the veggies that reminded me of a salad.  Literally took me over an hour to enjoy my plate.  One cuz I am a slow eater; two cuz it deserved to be savoured.  Fish eaters, I highly recommend the sea bass.

2,Pepin,"News Flash!  Pepins is a far cry from traditional Spanish cuisine and somehow, someone thought that they would classify it as ""Basque Cuisine"" also.  I guess it sounds good to throw that in.  Me thinks not!  The cuisine has nothing to do with Basque cuisine.  The Spanish cuisine is very much Americanized.  Since most people on this planet have not traveled to Pais Basco (Basque Country, located in the most northern, central region of Spain and partly in France) the owners of Pepins must think that the consumer will take their word for it.  Pepins food is not ""terrible"", but it's not Spanish, and it's definitely not Basque!  The service was atrocious when we went.  The Paella, was hardly a paella.  The garlic shrimp was pretty good though.  And what's up with the Salsa dancing in a ""Spanish"" restaurant.  Weird.

The private banquet room was very polished looking with individual lighting, music controls and private doors - the room even had a 60"" presentation screen so that we could play PowerPoint slides celebrating dad's life achievements. The menus even had a personalized birthday logo/message for dad - these soft personal touches really carried far!!

Seeing as how our guests were 95% Korean and of the conservative older generation, I was slightly worried that they may not like the non-traditional Hawaiian cuisine; however, they all raved and loved the Asian inspired dishes and said they fit their palates perfectly.

4,Salad King Restaurant,"Wonderful Thai place that is becoming quite popular around town

Salad King is a pretty big place that doesn't seem to be empty ever. The restaurant itself has seating along the windows, but also offers cafeteria style benches for those looking to cozy up in this winter weather and grab some good food. The restaurant serves up neo-Thai dishes and offers a spice chart that borders on the insane. (It can get pretty spicy).

Our party ordered the Pattaya Chicken, Combination Spicy, and something called Islamic Noodles, which is not found on the menu so I guess it's a hidden item. Also ordered an appetizer of miniature shrimp rolls because we just aren't quite fat enough. 

The Mini Shrimp Rolls weren't good. They were not bad, as they are tiny shrimps deep fried in spring roll (wheat) batter. The shrimp were miniature, as advertised, but I was hoping for something tastier or more of them. Ten or so pieces of shrimp scattered across a plate, so I would probably avoid getting it again.

However, the entrees were incredible. The Pattaya Chicken was fantastic. Lightly fried chicken breast pieces tossed with thyme, onion, bell peppers, carrots, honey, and lime chili sauce. The chicken was airfully crisp and the flavors from the vegetables blended well. The aroma was citrusy, but the flavors were a bit sweet and spicy from the honey and veggies. This was my dish and, though I shared it this time, my friends won't be so lucky next time.

The Combination Spicy is a dish comprising of chicken, squid, and shrimp tossed with veggies and lemongrass chili sauce. The dish was a tad spicy (2 chilis on the spice scale), but the flavor was not overpowered by the spice. The meats were a bit small but at least there was a good helping of it. 

The Islamic Noodles was a dish combining pork and chicken atop pad thai noodles and a coconut curry sauce. The dish itself was unbelievably good and I thought it had a kick to it as well. What surprised me about this dish was that I was expecting sweet but it was not noticeably bad at all. The dish kicks you in the mouth with flavor. Words aren't really enough, just order the damn thing.

I will make my way back here again soon. I loved that none of the entrees were over $10 and they were delicious and filling (all dishes come with a side of rice). The service was stellar and the environment was perfect for a nice night out. Really close to the Eaton Centre and Ryerson also so this place is definitely not a secret (though the Islamic Noodles are)...",2012/12/27,Toronto,-79.3814998,43.6576976,"['Restaurants', 'Thai']"

They have fries, which I like because even though this is a pasta shop, I like that they have Classic American sides. They also have good prices, so I think that you get a good bang for your buck. 
I have read reviews on here that the staff is somewhat Rude, and I will vogue for that and say that everybody is right. I always get it to go tho, so the rudeness does not bother me because Oftentimes when I am in AZ I am alone so I just go back to my house.

Mediocre food at best, service is ok, but the beer selection is sadly poor and their taps are dirty with flat draft beer the result.

Had to get some of the wings of course. They use fresh wings and never frozen which makes a big deference that you can taste. They get them straight from the chicken farms and avoid the middle man. Nice large wings that take more than a few bites to finish. Ordered them with Honey BBQ sauce with some hot sauce on the side for a little extra kick. I thought they were most excellent. Also ordered a West Coast style Philly which is like the standard Philly but with lettuce, tomatoes and a little mayo. Not bad at all. Next time I think I will try just the Steak and Cheese version or The Works. They also offer several appetizers and a couple salads that you can choose from the menu.

4,Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant,"This is our go-to restaurant for big lobster.  We love the lobster mountain here.  Fisherman Club only serves live seafood, no matter which set menu and which size of the lobster that you order.  The waiter will bring the moving lobster to you for approval prior to cooking it.  They can cook a lobster in many ways, but they charge a fee if you request the spicy stir fried style (unless the set menu already calls for this style).  The steamed sea bass included the 3-4 people set menu is about 1 lb and is small for 3-4 people.  

I like the big lobster here over the one at Omei, because the lobster here can be as small as 4 lb.  This is a more reasonable size for a small family dinner.  

Just a note that Fisherman carries lobster from slightly over 1 lb to over 9 lbs.  If the set menu calls for a certain size lobster, and they show you a bigger lobster and you agree to it, they will charge you for the extra weight at $17/lb.  If you don't like the bigger lobster they bring out, you should ask them to get another one; you just have to specify the weight you prefer.  More often, you will end up with a lobster slightly bigger than the weight as specified in the menu, though.

Cash only.  Reservation is highly recommended even for weekdays.",2013/3/12,Toronto,-79.30079543,43.82423358,"['Seafood', 'Restaurants', 'Chinese', 'Live/Raw Food']"

3,Ellis Island Cafe,"I was not overly impressed with this place to be honest. We were asking around for some good places to eat from some fellow vacationers and someone told us about Ellis Island. We decided that we would give it a try, due to how highly this tourist talked of it. 
This place had a couple of good things about it but overall I don't think I will be going back. 

First of all it's really loud because it's in the middle of a casino and karaoke goes on right next door, so if you're looking for an intimate place to take someone, this is not your place. I know it's Vegas and there are casinos everywhere but I feel like this place would have more success if it was a secluded restaurant. 

We ordered calamari for an appetizer and then I decided I would go with the spaghetti with sausage. It had a fancier name on the menu but that's what it was. I WAS NOT impressed at all with the spaghetti at all. The noodles weren't cooked very well and the sauce tasted like it was justo poured out of a can. The only thing that got me through it was the sausage and even that wasn't very good. I would honestly give the food a 2 star. 2 because I saw some other meals that were there and they looked decent. The hand brewed Rootbeer is amazing if you stop by here though. 

What made me give that extra star for this place was our waiter. This guy was pretty awesome. He was personal, he did a great job and incredibly helpful when we were all ordering. I really appreciate that in a higher end restaurant. 

Overall you won't find me back here because there are so many places that are better right around town. This place has potential to be better, they are just and missing a few elements to really progress as a business.",2016/1/28,Las Vegas,-115.1634847,36.1130255,"['Restaurants', 'American (Traditional)']"

4,Vince Neil's Tatuado EAT DRINK PARTY,"One of the only places open for a late lunch at Circus Circus, as the buffet closes at 2pm and the pizzeria's line is very long.  The food offerings are generally American - burgers, salads, sandwiches, and there are a few Mexican options (tacos and burritos).  I had the shrimp tacos and I recommend it.  A tad spicy, as there are pieces of jalapenos or peppers hiding under the cabbage and salsa.  There is a fair amount of shrimp in each taco, not just two pieces.  The sauce is zesty, so additional sauce isn't necessary. You get three in an order.  I also tried some of my bf's avocado cheeseburger - juicy and huge.  Those fries are something else!  I'm not sure what it is, but the coating, shape and crunch are not like typical French fries (they kind of remind me of churros - they are dark and shaped more round with sharp edges than square).

This place is loud, with TVs playing music videos from the past, which is kind of neat (you don't see 80's or 90's music videos at restaurants many places nowadays) and nostalgic.  Decor here is Motley Crue instruments, awards and wardrobes, so that's the theme - hair/rock bands.  It looks like there is a stage in the center of the restaurant, so I assume a band or DJ plays/spins on weekend evenings.  Staff is friendly and quick to seat you.

1,Flancer's,"Four of us went here today for lunch.  We've probably been to Flancer's 4-5 times and have always previously thought their food is well above average, and the service was fine to good.  Today, there were multiple issues.  The place was fairly busy, but it's quite small, so it should be very manageable for the wait staff.  

The waitress initially greeeted us and went right into ""are you ready to order?"" in 15 seconds.  We had literally just sat down and hadn't looked at the menus yet.  After asking her to give us a minute to decide, she took forever to come back and get the order.  We placed the order and then waited, I'd guess, 35-40 minutes to get the food.  3 of us 4 ordered hot dishes.....they all came to the table cold....I'd guess that they had been sitting out for at least 15 minutes, so there's why it took so long for us to get them.  Clearly, the kitchen had gotten it out in a timely manner, so things broke down after that.

After we sent them back to be re-heated, the waitress' attitude began to deteriorate.  Another waiter came back with the re-heated foods, and all of the sides were mixed up with with the entrees....we had to re-plate all of the meals ourselves.  Not to mention, one of the sides didn't come back at all, so we had to inform him that we were still waiting on a plate of fries.  After that, the waitress never returned to check on us....we had to flag her down to let her know that we were ready for the check (we had been done eating for quite some time) and she gave a look of irritation.  

After another long wait, we got the bill and took it up to the register to pay, as did many of the other guests, because we figured it would be faster than waiting on our waitress to process it.  We were in line with four other groups who wanted to pay, but no one was manning the register.  A waiter finally came up and asked all of the various groups if we were ready to be seated!  After informing him that we all had already eaten and needed to pay, someone manned the register and we finally made our way out.

Total time at the restaurant...mind you we all had easy things like club sandwiches....2 HOURS!  

Not once did I see a manager in the place.....no one was running the place.....

One of the many irritated customers asked to speak to a manager at one point (there were service issues all over the place), so another waiter was sent over to their table.  The customer said ""I asked for a manager"" and the waiter said ""I'm it"".

This ship was sailing without a captain today......and it was sinking fast.  

As we were leaving, I saw our original waitress walking out of the restaurant in a hurry....her body language suggested that she might have been walking out/quit, but I can't be sure.....maybe she was just going to her car to get something, but I don't think so....

The food was good, but with all of these issues, I'm guessing we won't be back for quite some time, if ever.  There are just too many other choices with good service....I hope for their sake this was a one-day issue and not an ongoing problem",2014/4/6,Mesa,-111.719349,33.450123,"['Sandwiches', 'Restaurants', 'Pizza', 'Burgers']"

She then disappeared again, my wife's friend happened to know server who then came and sat us.  At this point I'm pretty sure everyone working there was stoned.  We ordered apps and drinks then ordered pizza.  I would like to say the food was good but they forgot to put our pizza in.

2,Carnevino,"My first Batali/Bastianich experience and unfortunately it'll probably be my last. There's very little good I could find in my experience at Carnevino. First, the service was horrendous. After ordering a bottle of wine, the waiter poured us a glass, then took the bottle away from the table where we were left waiting 20-25 minutes for someone to bring it back to fill up an empty glass. We also had to ask for a basket of bread after realizing all the other tables except ours received one upon arriving. 

Food:

Tagliatelle with Porcini Trifolati: Sauce was decent, pasta was overcooked. In a restaurant that's owned by these 2? Weird.

Grilled Sweetbreads: Saved this place from getting 1 star. This dish was awesome. If you find yourself here and you like sweetbreads I'd highly recommend them. 

16 oz New York Strip:  Four people at our table ordered it medium rare and they all came cooked a different way. Truly surprising and really unacceptable. One of the steaks felt and tasted like it had been sitting for at least 30 minutes. When we brought the inedible steak up to the waiter he didn't even blink when telling us we wouldn't be charged for it. The impression I got was that it happens all the time.

In a place like Vegas where every world-class chef has at least one restaurant I would absolutely go somewhere else. I guess you could chalk my story up to ""a bad night"" but it really was dreadful.

2,Firefly Tapas Kitchen and Bar,"Having been to the Firefly on Paradise a month and a half ago, I was really excited to find that there were other locations in the valley not quite so crowded and busy. So, we made a reservation to celebrate our anniversary tonight, and unfortunately, this location was a real bummer compared to the other one.

Wish I'd noticed that a bunch of the reviews on this location appear to be for the Paradise location, not the Anthem location BEFORE we made a reservation. If you're reviewing here, people, this is the Anthem location we're talking about! :)

We started with the baked tetilla and smoked salmon toasts. The tetilla itself was great, but there was a large quantity of cheese and we only got four small, thin pieces of bread to dip in the cheese. They were also served in the cheese, so all were half-soggy by the time we got them. We made up for the rest by using the bread plate. We had almost finished by the time the waiter returned to ask if we needed more bread.

I had really enjoyed the smoked salmon toasts at the other location, and was so bummed to pick up my first one and find that it was burned black and so dry it was broken in half. One other was this way also (black and broken), and the other two were quite dark but at least they weren't broken. Really dry, though, and I lost out on any flavor that might have been on them. The salmon was tasty and the cream was nice as well, though.

We tried the Firefly fish with panko and spicy tartar sauce next, and were surprised by how stinky the fish was. I also live inland--even further inland than Nevada, in fact--and I've always found tilapia to be light on the aroma and to typically smell like the sea. Our tilapia was just plain stinky. Very fishy, very strong. Neither Husband nor I finished our fish.

The mango BBQ ribs were so tender the bones fell out of the meat, and the sauce was good, but we were pretty disenchanted by this point and decided to move on to dessert.

Bummer news--dessert wasn't up to snuff either. I'd gotten the dessert platter at the Paradise location and enjoyed everything on it, but we just wanted a bit of dessert, so Husband picked the lemon berry tarts. I knew they'd be tiny-tiny, having had the ones at the other location, but I was downright disappointed when I discovered the tiny tart shells were barely 1/3 full. And, if you've eaten there, you know that means there's probably between 1/2 tsp. and 1 tsp. of filling. The shells only fit about a tablespoon. The lemon filling was absolutely indistinguishable due to the higher proportion of tart crust and fresh berries (which were very sweet and tasty, thank heaven, or the dessert would have been absolutely irredeemable).

Service wasn't nearly as good as at the Paradise location, where I felt the waiter worked for my tip and I rewarded him handsomely in return. Here, where they were probably half to a third as busy, our waiter showed up at strange times and there were big lags between one course and the next. He was a perfectly adequate waiter but I knew I could expect better from this restaurant group. Our back waiter and runner were actually better than the waiter himself. They were quick, attentive, and helpful, and worked our table wonderfully.

So, a $55 meal I didn't enjoy all that much, but at least my belly is full. If you want the real Firefly experience, please go to the Paradise location. It's worth the wait AND the noise--and this is coming from someone who prefers a more serene dining experience, typically. Oh well.

The buffet was adequate and stock with traditional Indian dishes. Chicken Tikka, pakoras, lentils, chickpeas, rice, curry of sorts..  etc. 

I ate rice, the red chicken, some ckickpeas, some eggplant, zucchini, pakoras, naan. The rice was basmati and a little dry. The red chicken was good, chickpeas a little sandy, the eggplant/lentils was good...the chicken tikka was a little dry even in all that sauce. The naan was garlic and good.

The bar is set up well for live music with a good size stage with floor space in front of it. We caught a great country cover band I believe was named Zona Roads. It's not a fine dining establishment and if you get your expectations in line and stick to the basics like burgers, nachos, fries etc you will have a good time - It's beer and bar food and they do it well.

2,Big Smoke Burger,"A burger like this makes the baby Jesus cry. Given the fawning reviews of this place, I was really looking forward to a good, juicy burger. I ordered a meal that pulled out all the caloric stops: a cheeseburger, poutine, and a chocolate shake. While the poutine was decent and the shake serviceable (but thin), the burger was egregiously bad. The meat was Sahara-dry and seriously overcooked. The bun was cold. I can eat me a burger, but I couldn't even choke half of my Craft Burger down. So. Very. Disappointing. 

The restaurant is rather small, and isn't very good for groups. The service, on the other hand, was quite nice and smiley.

A piping hot stone bowl of purple rice is also given with your meal. 

The waiter will usually scrape the rice out and add water to the rice to make a sweet purse rice dessert but I always ask them to not add water and I end up adding the extra soup from the sundubu inside at the end, scrape and get some nice crunchy rice soaked in the spicy stew.

It just wasn't that good. My omelette was pretty runny and my potatoes were underdone. The biscuits, that the place is named after, were good but not memorable. The staff was pleasant and the atmosphere was clean and warm. I just wish the food was better.

Was the food good you ask? yeah, it was alright. It wasn't fantastic, but just good enough to leave me without any  complaints. Miso soup and wakame salad are pretty much the same anywhere you go. Their edemame had no salt surprisingly. The rolls were just what you expect to get at almost any decent sushi place.

Good sandwich shops usually pride themselves on bigger, larger more monstrous sandwiches with endless meat combinations. Not this one. These sandwiches are well portioned, affordable and will only set you back a few bucks. Even the simple $3 sandwiches (like the fried egg) are glorious, but as you go up the menu, the quality and creativity only grow, and even the most expensive sandwiches are only $9 (for sandwiches with Foie Gras or Truffles!).

5,Don Jose Mexican Food,"I have been coming to this restaurant for over 35 years (except for the brief shut down).  It was a family owned restaurant, and they were wonderful. It was reopened  and  they have increased the menu to include chicken and a few other things, while still retaining the family recipes. I love their food, and as to the few bad reviews here- I would disregard them. I love the hot sauce-it is not salsa with tomatoes and onions and chunks- that is fine with me -I love the flavor- calling it bland is BS- it has wonderful flavor just no chunks. It is not watered down.  Their tacos, beans and enchiladas are the best I have ever had at ANY restaurant. I don't like chipotle or a smoky chile flavor. They fry the taco with the meat in it, and I prefer that to  slopping juicy meat in a fried shell and having the bottom of the shell dissolve on your first bite. The enchiladas are not made with that yucky dark reddish brown sauce that is at most restaurants- that only taste of chile nothing else. these have a lot of flavor, and the comment about them using a non dairy cheese was just an out and out lie- Cheese MELTS, and they are wonderful! My whole family loves it- extended family as well. So take the word of someone who has eaten a lot of Mexican food- I am 56 years old and I have lived here my whole life- I am not a transplant from somewhere else- who has no clue what real Mexican food tastes like. If you like black beans or shrimp and seafood Mexican then this is not the restaurant for you- it is Sonoran- which is my favorite!! I do think you should have free refills on chips, but they are very generous with their refills on  beverages. As far as service goes- they are right on everything- I do figure if the restaurant is completely full that you might be a little more patient- or come back when they are not quite so busy.

3,Acacia Cafe,"This place is real small so I have never tried it, but I was going with a friend who likes it. I noticed a small patio and with the perfect weather I was enthused! You have to order at the counter then they bring the food to you.  Drinks are self serve. I had a coupon for buy one entree, get one 50% off, even with that I paid $16.61 for an omelet, french toast, an iced tea and a small orange juice! It was basic food, so I felt this was expensive, without coupon it would have been at least $20 and this is counter ordering. I can pay this much and have the same quality and table service. I guess that is why Snooze had a wait, so we went here.

I had an omelet with chees, added ham and green peppers.  The peppers were totally raw, they would be MUCH better cooked or at least hot, not added at the end and the omelet folded over. I asked for fruit with it, which was old! The melon was translucent and I didn't touch it! My friend ordered the French Toast and crisp bacon. The bacon was crisp, not greasy and good. The French Toast did have cinnamon but was a typical slice, nothing extrodinary.  They said it came with real maple syrup,  but it comes in a place ice cup, like the jams, so you have no label to see what you are eating.  The juice is touted as being fresh squeezed, but not what you would think, to me that means they squeeze it, then serve it! When I asked further I was told it is squeezed at a company in Tempe, that makes it local-good, but WHEN was it squeezed??

I was told they had experimented with a super spicy sauce for a while, but they are now back to their regular and manageable level of flavorful sauce, which is perfect for me. 

I would come here to work from 'home', sitting at a table with my computer (although I don't believe they have internet) or sitting on the sofas by the door for reading/editing work.

1,Mastro's City Hall,"I really do not like to write bad reviews, however, If there was a bad review I have been waiting to write it was this one...  If anyone has read any of my other reviews it is easy to see I eat at a lot of places all over the country.  I have been to some really high end/expensive establishments.  I have to say that this has to be the most unreasonably over priced steak house I have ever been to.  We walked and and were seated at our reservation time.  They were probably 75% full when we arrived.  We sat at our table 5-10 minutes before the first person came to our table.  It was another 5-10 minutes before we received water and bread that we did not even want.  As we were waiting for our water, we did open the menu and we were quite entertained with the $3200.00 bottles of wine, $300+ appetizers, $100.00 steaks.  I get it, It is a high end establishment, but if you are commanding premium prices, then you ought to be providing 100% premium services and food.  So on to that part, the food...  I ordered chicken which was so OVER salted, I only ate one piece of it...  My wife ordered Halibut which was so dry that it was almost like rubber.  Our friends ordered steaks  (Filet), of which I tried and found them to be sour in taste.  The only thing this visit had that warrants a star rating, is the crab cake appetizer, $32.00 mind you, and the sweet potato fries, $10.00...  So, if you are looking to visit an establishment where you can flaunt your disposable income, or your looking to meet someone who is flaunting, this is your spot.  If you are looking for good food, and good service I would strongly recommend you try another spot.  

The manager did follow up with a call to see how our service was, and upon learning of our opinion on the visit, he offered us a bottle of wine, which we dont really drink.  When we told him we were not interested in wine, he said he would take $100.00 off of our next visit.  Given that we are out of town, that was of no value, and even if we were gong to be around longer, I would not go spend another $300.00 to get $100.00 off.

$$$$ of in Yelp talk ~$61 per person does not describe what you can expect to pay per person here.  That will be just for your main entree item (singular), no side, no drink, no appetizer, no sweets.. Oh, you will get bread... Expect to pay roughly $100 per person at least if you want 3 courses.",2013/9/2,Scottsdale,-111.9313997,33.5012412,"['Restaurants', 'Steakhouses', 'Seafood', 'American (Traditional)']"

4,Asi Es La Vida,"I went here for the first time at lunch today, after having passed by the place about a zillion times!  After reading other reviews, I knew better than to accept their ""offer"" of chips and guacamole.  I think it's strange that they would charge people for that when it's not even listed on the menu as an option.  Also, when they brought out chips and salsa prior to our meal, they literally gave us a PLATE that had maybe 6-8 chips on it!  Really??  Thumbs down for that!  I guess if you're not ordering the chips and guac you're just SOL.

However, the food was really good!  I had the verde enchiladas, and the verde sauce was great!  My friend ordered the conchita (sp?) with mole sauce.  She loved it!  We both had the watermelon juice and it was delish and very refreshing.  

They also have a ""check-in"" offer from Yelp, that will get you a free dessert, which we used.  The default dessert must be flan, because that's what she automatically brought out to us.  It was good, but not great.

Sub was cold cuts and fresh veggies on a decent Italian sub roll, big enough for two people to share, taste was good, better than what you would get at a subway. Nachos were corn tortilla rounds with nacho cheese sauce, chopped meat, onion, jalapeno, and sour cream. Again, nothing spectacular, but it was about what I expected for the price. It's not bad food, for a relatively low price, and they deliver, so if that fits your craving I think you'll be satisfied.",2015/8/6,Phoenix,-112.2819471,33.49391568,"['American (Traditional)', 'Restaurants', 'Sandwiches', 'Mexican', 'Hot Dogs', 'Cheesesteaks', 'Tacos', 'American (New)']"

4,The Sheep Heid Inn,"I have come here several times now, and must say I really like it.

Having lived most of my life in the countryside, going to a cosy pub or cafe was the reward at the end of a long walk. Edinburgh is great at providing instant satisfaction, but sometimes it's nice to go through the ordeal of facing the elements, in exchange for a nice reward. 

Most times I have been to the Sheep Heid Inn, I have really come face to face with the Scottish weather. To get to Duddington, one must walk around the foot of arthur's seat, a passage, a path that is often blasted with gail force winds which feel like continuous slaps across the face, made even more severe by the hail, drizzle, or whatever else Scotland feels like throwing at you. Aside from this, it's a pleasant walk. Arthur's seat is beautiful, and you will see the loch at Duddingston before actually reaching the village.

I advise you to walk a little around the cobblestone streets before entering the pub. There's a cute little church overlooking the loch, which is itself quite a stage to the spectacle of elegant swans. You may think you just stepped into Hogsmeade? Not so far off. Apparently this little village influenced even J.K.Rowling.

The pub prides itself in being the oldest in Scotland. Inside, it does feel a little more modern than one might expect, but it still retains a certain charm. Arriving after a wee walk in the cold is a massive relief. Though the quality of the drinks is great, they are a bit pricier here than elsewhere. I have had some good cider and gin and tonics here over the years, and came here for New Years eve for two years running. There's a skittles alley, a VERY difficult pub quiz, and a area reserved to dining upstairs.

I am yet to try the food, but it looks very good went put out on the plate!",2013/3/20,Edinburgh,-3.1478383,55.9421266,"['Restaurants', 'Bars', 'Pubs', 'Gastropubs', 'British', 'Nightlife']"
2,Korean BBQ,"We got lazy and desperate for Korean food.   We initially drove to Fmp for Korean express after reading all the great Yelp reviews.   Alas, they were closed.... 

So we settled for Korean BBQ.   

Pros: we were lazy and it was next to our bbt joint.   

Cons: we asked for extra spice.  Seeing as we are Asian, the Korean owner perhaps thought we couldn't handle it and made it mildly spice.   Even the Kimchi they served as the mini app was spicier. 

I got the Kimchi soup.   It was full of..... Tofu, some Kimchi and some mixed leftover meat pieces.   It was not Spicy, and pretty bland to be honest.   After I finished all I wanted was more water because of all the salt I just finished.  The rice was just regular, not that amazing soft and slightly sticky Korean rice. 

The husband got the Gamjatang.   At least he had adequate protein.   

I know, keep your standards low at a food court.   But for the price we paid $8 for gamjatang and Kimchi soup..... I'm going to complain, just a little.   Thank goodness they didn't serve us with those challenging Korean chopsticks.

4,Paul's Club,"CROWDED! This place is always crowded on the weekends (a good thing!) but the space is not conducive for huge crowds. I am always pushing my way down the center to find a place where I can hopefully weasel my way towards the bar to grab a drink. 

Regardless of this, I love coming here! It's a great place to meet friends and have a beer. I've been both on the weeknights and weekends. Boyfriend and I come here during the week to sit at the bar and grab a beer. It's a great place to hang out. They have fun, throwback music during the week, and it's oftentimes very easy to get some couch seating. During the weekend, I often come here to meet friends. If you're lucky, you can snag some couch seating, which is oh so fun! Reminds me of having bottle service in Vegas for some reason. It's very cozy and a great place to hang out, talk, and drink. I probably wouldn't end my night here. It's definitely the kind of place to start the night and then head up or down State. 

Good vibes here, too. Love the lighting-- not too dark, not too bright! And the tree-- adore the tree! It gives off such a unique, fun ambiance. Do not believe people who tell you it is real. It's not. ;)

They also have a great tap list of beers I've never heard of, which I love. I am always down to try a new beer, so this is the place to do it.

They started off with some songs and introductions. The Wizard got people involved and cheering. The show involved jousting, racing and sword fighting. You cheer on your knight as he battles to be the champion.
The food was surprisingly tasty. We didn't obviously go there for the food, but were pleasantly surprised. They started with tomato soup (AKA Dragons Blood) and then brought out the main course. It was a Cornish game hen, some roasted red potatoes and broccoli. It was very good. It was finished with a apple fritter. Service was slow at times.
The show also moved a decent pace and involved lots of special effects including fireworks and fire displays. We really enjoyed the show and would recommend it. We may even come again, if the opportunity arises, it was that good.

4,Laziza,"My dreams came true when Laziza first opened up when I was still living in Kent. My girlfriends and I were frequent visitors and literally came here once a week to gossip and eat their yummy Mediterranean cuisine. They also have a bunch of other options aside from Mediterranean, but I rarely ever go with anything besides the hummus with chicken entree. All entrees come with either a soup or salad, which is nice because a lot of restaurants charge extra if you want either before the actual meal. The chicken was always cooked to perfection and flavored with the perfect amount of spices. Add that to the rice and delicious hummus + veggies and you have yourself one good finger licking meal. 

Since moving to Cleveland and going back to Kent on occasion, I always make a point to return to my old watering hole and place my usual order. Management is always on point, service is good, but this past visit, I noticed my entree was not out of this world like I had remembered (granted it was homecoming weekend and they were super busy) Nonetheless, it was still a great dining experience and I can't wait to go back for the food and for the nostalgia of being a care free college student :)",2014/11/3,Kent,-81.35674004,41.15289543,"['Restaurants', 'Mediterranean']"

That being said, you would think we would have had excellent service and our orders correct.. Instead, terribly slow service, orders incorrect/incomplete. Had my friend not been an employee I would have insisted on asking for a manager. For starters, drinks from the bar took about 10 minutes if not longer to arrive at the table. For a restaurant less than half full, that is too long. As for the food, I asked for no jalape??os on my potatoes. They come out with it and our server quickly notices and offers to bring me another serving of them. She does and now they are without cheese.. Whatever, fine. Next two from our table are missing the bacon from their order, ask for it and the server brings them ONE serving and asks if that's ok.. Really.. Really? Sure, that's fine they would love to share 2 pieces of bacon. Who shares bacon? I believe had a member of the party not been an employee we may have had different treatment, but you would have thought we would have at least gotten a prompt service as well as accurate orders.

First off, I have a thing about filling out the stupid fucking check sheets all cheap, shitty sushi bars want you to fill out. NUMBER ONE, THEY HAVE ALL THE NAMES THEY MADE UP OF ALL THE SHIT THEY MAKE BUT NO EXPLANATION OF WHAT THEY ARE! WHAT THE HELL IS A SUNSHINE ROLL ANYWAY? So, I sit down, introduce myself  with a smile and ask the name of the sushi guy. I explain that I'd rather just have him tell me whats fresh and explain what kinds of things I like and would he mind just taking care of if. Simple enough in a empty goddamn sushi bar right? NO!!!! He basically tells me, if you don't fill out my stupid fucking directions, I'm not smart enough to prepare you sushi.

Not wanting to be a complete butt hole and stand up, leave and go to Yasu where they have a clue (a decision I am now regretting) I smile, fill out the sheet and wait for what I expect, the same ol shit you get at every strip mall sushi bar in the country.....
